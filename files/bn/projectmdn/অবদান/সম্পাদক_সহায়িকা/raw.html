    এটি আলাদা কোন পৃষ্ঠায় না গিয়ে, আপনি যেই পৃষ্ঠায় কাজ করছেন, সেখানেই থেকে আপনার নতুন পরিবর্তন গুলোকে সংরক্ষন করার কাজ করে। এই বোতামটি নতুন পৃষ্ঠা তৈরি করার সময় থাকে না। কিন্তু একবার যখন আপনি একটি নতুন পৃষ্ঠা তৈরি করে ফেলেছেন এবং একবার সংরক্ষন করেছেন, তারপর থেকে আপনি এই বোতামটি পাবেন। আর আপনারা আগেই জেনেছেন যে, নতুন কোন কিছু সম্পাদনা করলে মন্তব্য করতে হয়। তাই এই বোতামটি চাপার আগেও অবশ্যই মন্তব্য করতে হবে। আরও বিস্তারিত জানার জন্য {{anch("The revision comment box")}} দেখুন।

</dl>
<h3 id="The_page_info_box">The page info box</h3>
<p>The page info box contains information about the page, but also can be expanded to offer additional page controls. By default, it displays the page's title and the date and time at which a local draft was saved; the local draft, stored on your computer, is used as a backup in case you accidentally navigate away from the editor or your browser crashes.</p>
<p>You can click the "Edit Page Title and Properties" link to switch to a view offering additional page controls. This view looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5317/expanded-page-info.png" style="width: 517px; height: 69px;"></p>
<p>This view allows you to change the page's display title and the depth of the page's table of contents. The display title is the title shown in the browser's title bar (or tab bar) and as the title of the page at the top of the article and in the breadcrumb bar, as appropriate. It doesn't affect the page's URL.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> It's worth noting that we prefer short URLs and descriptive titles; for example, the article about the Kuma API has the title "The Kuma API" but its URL slug (the part after the site's root) is Project:MDN/Kuma/API, where "API" represents this page.</p>
</div>
<p>The TOC (table of contents) level lets you specify how deeply into the article's heading levels the table of contents automatically displayed on the page should go. By default, heading levels {{HTMLElement("h2")}} through {{HTMLElement("h4")}} are included in the TOC, so that the TOC has a three-level depth. However, you can set this to any of those, as well as "No TOC" (to not display a TOC at all, such as on landing pages) or to show all levels in the TOC.</p>
<p>As is the case with all changes you might make, changes in the page info box do not take effect unless you save the page.</p>
<h3 id="The_toolbar">The toolbar</h3>
<p>The editor's toolbar offers features that let you adjust the appearance and flow of the article as you work. There are two rows of buttons (more if the width of your window is narrow enough that they wrap, but generally two) and a third row that shows the hierarchy of HTML elements leading up to where you are. In the screenshot below, for example, you're writing inside a top-level {{HTMLElement("p")}} block.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5319/edit-toolbar.png" style="width: 771px; height: 88px;"></p>
<p>The toolbar's buttons are divided into seven groups. Let's look at each; we will examine the buttons in each group in order left-to-right.</p>
<h4 id="Document_options">Document options</h4>
<p>The document options box provides options for document-level manipulations:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Source mode toggle</dt>
  <dd>
    The source mode toggle button lets you toggle between editing using the WYSIWYG interface and in raw HTML source mode. We <strong>strongly</strong> request that you try to avoid using source mode, as it's very easy to wind up with content that doesn't match our style guide or, worse, doesn't work right at all. Currently, though, the editor has some quirks that make it impossible to do certain things without resorting to source mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Save and keep editing</dt>
  <dd>
    A duplicate for the main "Save and keep editing" button.</dd>
  <dt>
    Save and exit</dt>
  <dd>
    Just like the main "Save changes" button.</dd>
  <dt>
    Paste as plain text</dt>
  <dd>
    Opens a dialog into which you can paste text; the text has all styling stripped from it so that you don't inadvertently introduce unwanted styles into the site content. Once you've pasted your text, you can (optionally) make changes, then click a button to insert it into the article you're working on.</dd>
  <dt>
    Paste from Word</dt>
  <dd>
    On Windows, lets you paste text from Microsoft Word and have it adjusted to work reasonably well in MDN's wiki. We prefer for you to not use this (the results will work but are not typically style guide compliant), but it's there for a few teams that need it.</dd>
  <dt>
    Check spelling</dt>
  <dd>
    Starts the spell checker.</dd>
  <dt>
    Spell check as you type</dt>
  <dd>
    Presents a submenu that lets you control and configure the as-you-type spell checker.</dd>
  <dt>
    Find</dt>
  <dd>
    Opens the Find panel in "Find" mode, which lets you search your document for a specified string.</dd>
  <dt>
    Replace</dt>
  <dd>
    Opens the Find panel in "Find and replace" mode, allowing you to find strings and replace them with new ones.</dd>
</dl>
<p>It's worth noting that the Find and Replace buttons both take you to the same dialog box, which offers several configurable options for finding and optionally replacing text.</p>
<h4 id="Block-level_options">Block-level options</h4>
<p>These buttons provide options affecting or creating blocks in your article.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Insert/remove bulleted list</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates or removes a bulleted list from your article. Once you're working in a bulleted list, each time you press return, you will start a new bullet. The tab key can be used to indent a level, and shift-tab will outdent a level. Pressing return on an empty bullet will exit bullet list mode. Right-clicking on the list lets you choose to edit the list's properties (specifically, the shapes of the bullets).</dd>
  <dt>
    Insert/remove numbered list</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates or removes a numbered list from your article. Once you're working in a numbered list, each time you press return, you will start a new bullet. The tab key can be used to indent a level, and shift-tab will outdent a level. Pressing return on an empty bullet will exit numbered list mode. Right-clicking the list offers the option to open the properties dialog for the list; the properties include the style of the numbers (numbers, letters, Roman numerals, etc, and what number to start with).</dd>
  <dt>
    Definition list</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new definition list. Definition lists consist of a series of titles and definitions (this list you're reading right now is an example).</dd>
  <dt>
    Definition title</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new title in a definition list. If you're not already editing a definition list, a new one is created for you. Pressing return after entering a definition title automatically starts you editing a definition description.</dd>
  <dt>
    Definition description</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new description in a definition list. Pressing return on a description line automatically starts a new title. Pressing return twice will exit definition list mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Decrease indent</dt>
  <dd>
    Shifts the indentation level to the left once; this is the same as shift-tab while in a list.</dd>
  <dt>
    Increase indent</dt>
  <dd>
    Shifts the indentation level to the right once; this is the same as tab while in a list.</dd>
  <dt>
    Blockquote</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a blockquote. <strong>Please do not use this</strong>. Blockquotes are not part of our standard style guide, and this button will be removed in the near future.</dd>
  <dt>
    Image</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a new image into the article. See {{anch("Adding images to an article")}} below for details on how to use this option.</dd>
  <dt>
    Table</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a table into the article. See {{anch("Working with tables")}} for more information on tables in articles.</dd>
  <dt>
    Text color</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you set the text foreground color. <strong>Please do not use this.</strong> We will switch to using CSS styles for all coloring soon.</dd>
  <dt>
    Background color</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you set the text background color. <strong>Please do not use this.</strong> We will switch to using CSS styles for all coloring soon.</dd>
  <dt>
    Text direction left-to-right</dt>
  <dd>
    Sets LTR as the current text typing direction. Used only when covering localization/internationalization topics.</dd>
  <dt>
    Text direction right-to-left</dt>
  <dd>
    Sets RTL as the current text typing direction. Used only when covering localization/internationalization topics.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Maximize">Maximize</h4>
<p>This is an odd box, in that it consists of just one button: Maximize. This button causes the editor interface (that is, the toolbar and the edit box) to take over your entire browser window, giving you as much space as possible to write.</p>
<h4 id="Headings">Headings</h4>
<p>The heading buttons let you insert a heading. Click one of these buttons to create a new heading at the corresponding depth. By default, H2 through H4 are included in the table of contents, but you can change this, as described in {{anch("The page info box")}}.</p>
<h4 id="Formatting_styles">Formatting styles</h4>
<p>The next box is a drop-down menu offering a selection of special formatting options. These are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    None</dt>
  <dd>
    Removes all styling from the current block.</dd>
  <dt>
    Note box</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a note box, as seen below. You should always start a note box with "<strong>Note:</strong>" in bold letters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This is a note box.</p>
</div>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Warning box</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a warning box, as seen below. These should always begin with "<strong>Warning:</strong>" in bold letters.</dd>
</dl>
<div class="warning">
  <p><strong>Warning:</strong> This is a warning box.</p>
</div>
<pre class="syntaxbox">foo = bar()</pre>
<div class="standardSidebar" style="text-align: center;">
  <strong>Special note</strong><br>
  This is a right sidebar.</div>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Callout box</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new callout box. We are phasing this kind of box out in favor of a new design, <strong>so it shouldn't be used</strong> for new content.</dd>
  <dt>
    Two columns</dt>
  <dd>
    Makes the selected text or the current block two columns instead of one, on browsers that support it.</dd>
  <dt>
    Three columns</dt>
  <dd>
    Makes the selected text or the current block three columns instead of one, on browsers that support it.</dd>
  <dt>
    Syntax box</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a syntax box, such as the one shown below. You need to use the "PRE" button as well, to create a {{HTMLElement("pre")}} block inside it. You probably won't see the yellow box until you do.</dd>
  <dt>
    Right sidebar</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a light grey sidebar that floats to the right of content. You may enter small amounts of text in these boxes to draw special attention to them.</dd>
  <dt>
    SEO summary</dt>
  <dd>
    This special style is used to indicate a sentence or two that should be used as the article's summary for SEO purposes. It's also used by macros that automatically construct landing pages. If you don't specify this, MDN automatically uses the first paragraph of your article, but sometimes that's not the optimal text (or it's too much text), so this lets you override that.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Code_samples_and_redirects">Code samples and redirects</h4>
<p>These buttons are mostly used for providing preformatted text (usually code samples), but our "insert redirect" button is, for some reason, here too.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    PRE</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a {{HTMLElement("pre")}} (preformatted text) block, or turns the current block into one. All code samples or examples of text output to a terminal should be in one of these blocks.</dd>
  <dt>
    Syntax highlighter</dt>
  <dd>
    The syntax highlighter lets you choose a language for which to apply syntax highlighting to the{{HTMLElement("pre")}} (preformatted text) block; if you're not already in such a block, this will create one for you. Simply choose the language and you're good to go.</dd>
  <dt>
    Insert code sample template</dt>
  <dd>
    This button is used by the live sample system to help you quickly insert a new live sample. You don't need to use it, but it's there for convenience. See {{anch("Using the live sample system")}} for details on using this and other live sample features.</dd>
  <dt>
    Insert code sample iframe</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} into the document, displaying a given live sample. See {{anch("Using the live sample system")}} for details on using this and other live sample features.</dd>
  <dt>
    Create a redirect</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a redirect. See {{anch("Creating redirects")}} for further information.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Inline_styles_and_links">Inline styles and links</h4>
<p>The final group of toolbar buttons includes options for creating and maintaining links and anchors, as well as for applying inline styles to content.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Link</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates a new link. This button opens the link editor dialog, which is covered under {{anch("Creating and editing links")}} below.</dd>
  <dt>
    Unlink</dt>
  <dd>
    Removes the link at the insertion point.</dd>
  <dt>
    Anchor</dt>
  <dd>
    Creates an anchor at the insertion point.</dd>
  <dt>
    Bold</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles boldface text mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Italic</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles italic text mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Underline</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles underlined text mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Code</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles {{HTMLElement("code")}} mode. This is used for inline presentation of variable names, function names, object names, filenames, and so forth.</dd>
  <dt>
    Strike through</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles strikethrough mode.</dd>
  <dt>
    Superscript</dt>
  <dd>
    Toggles superscript mode. Please note that we don't use footnotes on MDN, so you should rarely if ever need this button.</dd>
  <dt>
    Remove format</dt>
  <dd>
    Removes the current formatting from the selection.</dd>
  <dt>
    Align left</dt>
  <dd>
    Makes the current block left-aligned. <strong>Please do not use this.</strong> We will be using CSS styles for all alignment tasks starting very soon.</dd>
  <dt>
    Center</dt>
  <dd>
    Centers the current block. <strong>Please do not use this.</strong> We will be using CSS styles for all alignment tasks starting very soon.</dd>
  <dt>
    Align right</dt>
  <dd>
    Makes the current block right-aligned. <strong>Please do not use this.</strong> We will be using CSS styles for all alignment tasks starting very soon.</dd>
</dl>
<h3 id="The_edit_box">The edit box</h3>
<p>The edit box is, of course, where you actually do your writing. Right-clicking in the edito box will offer appropriate additional options depending on the context of your click; clicking in a table will offer table-related options and clicking in a list will offer list-related options, for example.</p>
<h3 id="The_revision_comment_box">The revision comment box</h3>
<p>After you've made your changes, it's strongly recommended you add a comment to your revision. This is displayed in the revision history for the page, as well as on the <a href="/en-US/dashboards/revisions" title="/en-US/dashboards/revisions">Revision Dashboard</a>. It helps to explain or justify your changes to others that may review your work later. To add a revision comment, simply type the note into the revision comment box before clicking either of the save buttons at the top of the page.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> We know that the revision comment box being so far away from the save buttons doesn't make any sense. We're working on design changes that will fix that.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="The_tags_box">The tags box</h3>
<p>Page tags help categorize and organize information, and help us identify pages that need special attention. Tags are also used to mark pages that are obsolete and may need to be deprecated or even deleted. It's incredibly useful to have good, clean tags on pages, so be sure to have good tags on articles you contribute to.</p>
<p>The tag box is near the bottom of the editor page, and looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="The tag editing box showing three tags." height="80" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5291/tagbox1.png" width="785"></p>
<h4 id="Adding_a_tag">Adding a tag</h4>
<p>To add a new tag, simply click in the box and start typing:</p>
<p><img alt="Screen thot: the tag box after typing a new tag but before pressing Enter." height="74" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5293/newtag-beforereturn.png" width="784"></p>
<p>Here we see the three already existing tags (as button-like objects) and our new tag as unadorned text. When we press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or <kbd>Tab</kbd> key (or comma), the new tag is committed to the list, and the list looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="Screen shot: the tag box with our new tag in place." height="81" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5295/newtag-afterreturn.png" width="784"></p>
<p>For a list of recommended tags, as well as a usage guide for specific tags, please see <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Tagging_standards">MDN tagging standards</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Removing_a_tag">Removing a tag</h4>
<p>There are two ways to remove a tag: you can click on the "x" icon next to its name in its button, or you can click to its right in the editor box and press the delete key on your keyboard.</p>
<h4 id="Committing_your_changes">Committing your changes</h4>
<p>Your changes are not saved unless you click one of the save buttons at the top of the editor window. Scroll back to the top of the window if you don't see the buttons, then click one of the two green save buttons. Now your change has been committed.</p>
<h3 id="The_reviews_box">The reviews box</h3>
<p>MDN uses <strong>reviews</strong> to try to monitor and improve the quality of its content. This works by setting a flag on an article indicating that a review is needed. You can learn more about <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/How_to_help#Content_reviews" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/How_to_help#Content_reviews">content reviews</a> and how they work in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/How_to_help" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/How_to_help">How to help</a> article.</p>
<p>To request a review on the article you've worked on, simply toggle on the checkbox next to the type of review that's needed. Technical reviews should be requested any time you make changes to the explanation of how something technical works, while editorial reviews are a good idea when you've made changes and would like someone to review your writing and style choices.</p>
<p>Be sure to click one of the save buttons after making your selections, to commit your review request.</p>
<h3 id="The_attachments_box">The attachments box</h3>
<p>The attachments box lets you upload files to MDN for use in MDN content, as well as see what files are being used by the current document.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Due to a quirk in our current implementation, files are not associated with pages unless they're actually used in the page. So if you upload an attachment and don't make use of it before you save the article, it will not appear on the attachments list. So be sure to link to it or embed the image right away.</p>
</div>
<p>To add an attachment to the page, simply click the "Attach Files" button; this expands the attachment box to look like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5321/attachments-empty.png" style="width: 600px; height: 114px;"></p>
<p>As you see, there's a table that lets you select a file to upload, then give it a title and, optionally, a description and an additional comment. The title is mandatory, and should describe the file so its usage context is understandable. Once the fields are filled out and you've selected your file, click the "Upload" button to send it to MDN.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> Only a select few types of files are permitted as attachments on MDN: GIF, JPEG, PNG, SVG, and HTML. Photoshop images are permitted but should be avoided except in very specific cases. Any other file types will not be allowed by the upload form.</p>
</div>
<p>Feel free to <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Editor_guide$edit" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Editor_guide$edit">open this page in the editor</a> and look at its attachment list at the bottom to get a feel for it.</p>
<p>Once a file has been attached, it will appear (by its title, as you specified in the form) in the image properties dialog box when using images in your article. See {{anch("Adding images to an article")}} for details on this interface. To link to other types of files, copy the URL from the attachments box and use that as your link target when adding links to the page using the link button in the toolbar.</p>
<h3 id="Keyboard_shortcuts">Keyboard shortcuts</h3>
<p>There are a number of convenient keyboard shortcuts available to help you avoid taking your hands off the keyboard while you work.  The shortcuts are listed for Windows and Linux; on Mac, instead of using the Control key, you can use the Command key.</p>
<table class="standard-table" style="max-width: 45em;">

<h2 id="Adding_images_to_an_article">Adding images to an article</h2>
<p>Once you've attached an article to the page (see {{anch("The attachments box")}}), you can use it in your article. You can also link to images elsewhere on MDN. To insert an image, click on the "Image" button in the toolbar, which looks like this: <img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5349/image-icon.png" style="width: 22px; height: 19px;"></p>
<p>The image properties dialog box that appears looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5331/image-properties-empty.png" style="width: 483px; height: 617px;"></p>
<p>There are three tabs; the first (and the one you'll use most) is the Image Info tab. The other two are the Link and Advanced tabs.</p>
<h3 id="Image_Info">Image Info</h3>
<p>There are many options here:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Attachments</dt>
  <dd>
    This popup menu shows a list of the page attachments. Only items you've uploaded during the current edit session, or that are already used elsewhere on the page, will be listed.</dd>
  <dt>
    URL</dt>
  <dd>
    If you wish to use an image that's not in the attachments list (for example, one attached elsewhere on MDN, or uploaded during a previous edit session), you can enter its URL in this field.</dd>
  <dt>
    Alternative text</dt>
  <dd>
    The alternative text to be displayed if the image is not displayed. This text is also used by screen readers, so please put an appropriate note here for the sake of accessibility.</dd>
  <dt>
    Width / Height</dt>
  <dd>
    You may adjust the width and height of the image as displayed in the article here. By default, these are locked to remain in proportion to one another, but you may toggle that by clicking on the lock icon.</dd>
  <dt>
    Border</dt>
  <dd>
    You may optionally specify the width of a black border to draw around your image. <strong>Please</strong> only use the value 0 (or leave blank) or 1 here, and you should only choose to use a border if your image has a pale background and should stand out from the the article's background.</dd>
  <dt>
    HSpace / VSpace</dt>
  <dd>
    These let you specify how much whitespace to surround the image with horizontally and vertically, respectively. You will usually only need to use these if you use the alignment option below.</dd>
  <dt>
    Alignment</dt>
  <dd>
    By default, images are displayed alone as their own block. However, you may choose here to float the image to the left or to the right, allowing text to wrap around it. We don't do this often; it's used only in very special cases where the image is small (or very narrow and tall) and there's enough text to put next to it to justify it. This is a bit of a judgement call. If you use this option, you will probably want to set HSpace and VSpace values to prevent the text from being too close to the image. A value of 6 or 8 for each usually works well.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The preview box gives an example of what the image will look like given your current settings.</p>
<h3 id="Link">Link</h3>
<p>The Link options tab for images lets you set a URL to go to when the image is clicked on. This is most commonly used to simply link to a larger version of the image itself (by providing the same URL as in the Image Info tab). The Link panel looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5333/image-properties-link.png" style="width: 479px; height: 525px;"></p>
<p>Other than the URL field, in which you place the URL of the link's destination, you can set a target. However, <strong>please do not do so</strong>. We prefer all links to open in the same tab.</p>
<h3 id="Supported_image_types">Supported image types</h3>
<p>You may upload GIF, JPEG, and PNG images, as well as SVG diagrams. For screenshots, we prefer PNG, and we're trying to transition to using SVG for diagrams because they can be translated into other languages more easily than other image types.</p>
<p>Photoshop files may also be uploaded. <strong>However</strong>, they may not be used as images inline in content.</p>
<h3 id="Removing_and_changing_images">Removing and changing images</h3>
<p>To remove an image from the article, you can simply select it and press your delete key, or place the cursor after it and press delete.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You cannot delete attachments on MDN; we will eventually have a mechanism for this, but at this time, they remain on the server for potential later re-use.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also revise the image properties for an image by double-clicking it, or right-clicking on it and choosing "Image Properties" from the context menu that appears. This will present the same dialog as above.</p>
<h2 id="Working_with_tables">Working with tables</h2>
<p>On MDN, we use tables primarily when presenting lists of information with more than two pieces of information per data point. If you're creating a list of items with a name and a value, you should typically use a definition list instead of a table; that is, we prefer to avoid using two-column tables. This is primarily because tables can be difficult to display and to read on mobile devices, so we try to avoid them when possible.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide">MDN style guide</a> for details on use of tables and their proper formatting; however, let's look at the actual method by which you insert and edit tables.</p>
<h3 id="Creating_a_table">Creating a table</h3>
<p>To insert a new table, click the Table icon in the toolbar, which looks like this: <img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5351/table-icon.png" style="width: 21px; height: 20px;"></p>
<p>Having done this, you'll be presented with the Table Properties dialog:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5355/table-properties.png" style="width: 367px; height: 444px;"></p>
<p>There are two panels here: Table Properties and Advanced.</p>
<h4 id="Table_properties">Table properties</h4>
<p>This panel is where you'll do most of your work configuring the table, as there are few items in the Advanced panel we recommend using. The options here are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Rows</dt>
  <dd>
    The number of rows in your table. You may add more rows while in the editor, but this lets you quickly configure your table.</dd>
  <dt>
    Columns</dt>
  <dd>
    The number of columns in your table.</dd>
  <dt>
    Headers</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you configure where your headers are, if any. By default, no header cells are added to your table; however, we generally prefer that tables have headers, so you should change this most of the time. The possible values are <strong>None</strong>, <strong>First row</strong>, <strong>First column</strong>, and <strong>Both</strong>.</dd>
  <dt>
    Alignment</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you align the table along the left, right, or center of the article. <strong>Please do not use this option.</strong> Our style guide specifies that tables should always be left-aligned. There are very few exceptions to this rule (usually only when we're being naughty and using tables for layout, which we're working on getting out of the habit of doing as we build out our CSS).</dd>
  <dt>
    Caption</dt>
  <dd>
    You may choose to add a caption to your table; however, we do not usually do so on MDN, so you will probably leave this blank.</dd>
  <dt>
    Summary</dt>
  <dd>
    You should typically leave this blank, as you should be providing appropriate explanatory text adjacant to your table.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Advanced">Advanced</h4>
<p>The Advanced panel provides a few additional options, most of which we don't use on MDN and will likely remove in the future.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5353/table-advanced.png" style="width: 366px; height: 445px;"></p>
<p>As you see here, there are only four options; they are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Id</dt>
  <dd>
    The {{HTMLElement("table")}} element's <code>id</code>. We generally do not use IDs on tables on MDN.</dd>
  <dt>
    Language Direction</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you establish the writing direction used in the table. This should be used only when localizing content.</dd>
  <dt>
    Style</dt>
  <dd>
    This field lets you hand-enter custom CSS. <strong>Do not use this field! We will probably remove your table if you do.</strong> We are trying to eliminate all uses of custom styles outside what's provided by our stylesheets.</dd>
  <dt>
    Stylesheet Classes</dt>
  <dd>
    This lets you specify a stylesheet class to use for the table. This should nearly always be "standard-table", which is our standard table class.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once you've finished configuring your table, click "OK" to create it.</p>
<h3 id="Working_with_tables">Working with tables</h3>
<p>Once a table has been created, working with it is very much like in any table editor, entering data into its cells. Pressing the tab key will advance you to the next cell in the table, wrapping to the next row if you're in the last cell in the row you're currently working on. If you're in the last cell of the last row when you press tab, a new row will be added to the end of the table, and the cursor will be placed in the first cell of the new row.</p>
<p>You may right-click on the table to get an assortment of options for adjusting the cells, rows, columns, and the table itself:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5363/table-context-menu.png" style="width: 185px; height: 252px;"></p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Paste</dt>
  <dd>
    On browsers that support pasting via script (some, including Firefox, do not, for security purposes), this will paste your clipboard at the current point in the table.</dd>
  <dt>
    Cell</dt>
  <dd>
    This submenu offers options related to the selected cell or cells. See {{anch("Cell options")}}.</dd>
  <dt>
    Row</dt>
  <dd>
    This submenu offers options related to the selected row or rows. See {{anch("Row options")}}.</dd>
  <dt>
    Column</dt>
  <dd>
    This submenu offers options related to the selected column or columns. See {{anch("Column options")}}.</dd>
  <dt>
    Delete Table</dt>
  <dd>
    Deletes the entire table. This option is listed twice due to a glitch we've yet to track down. Both do the same thing.</dd>
  <dt>
    Sort Table</dt>
  <dd>
    Opens a dialog box providing options for sorting the contents of the table. See {{anch("Sorting tables")}} below.</dd>
  <dt>
    Table Properties</dt>
  <dd>
    Opens the same table properties dialog used to create a new table. This option is listed twice due to a bug we haven't resolved yet. Both work just fine.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Cell_options">Cell options</h4>
<p>The cell options submenu offers options related to manipulating and editing cells in your table, and looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5359/table-context-cell.png" style="width: 343px; height: 287px;"></p>
<p>These options should be fairly self-explanatory, with the exception that "Merge Cells" is only available if you have selected multiple cells; you can then use this option to combine them into a single cell.</p>
<h4 id="Cell_properties">Cell properties</h4>
<p>The Cell Properties option opens a dialog box that gives you control over the details of a cell:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5367/table-cell-properties.png" style="width: 467px; height: 424px;"></p>
<p>The options you can configure here are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Width</dt>
  <dd>
    The width of the cell; you may change the units used for this value using the adjacent drop-down. <strong>Please don't use this.</strong> You shouldn't need to adjust widths of cells except in rare cases involving nesting images or example code within tables.</dd>
  <dt>
    Height</dt>
  <dd>
    The cell's height; this is always in pixels. <strong>Please don't use this.</strong> We prefer for cell sizes to be determined automatically, except in exceptionally rare cases.</dd>
  <dt>
    Word Wrap</dt>
  <dd>
    Specifies whether or not the cell's contents should be permitted to wrap. This should almost always be left at "Yes", the default.</dd>
  <dt>
    Horizontal Alignment</dt>
  <dd>
    Allows you to set the horizontal alignment for the cell's or cells' contents. This should almost always be left at the default.</dd>
  <dt>
    Vertical Alignment</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you set the vertical alignment of the cell or cells. This should nearly always be left at the default, but may be adjusted if necessary.</dd>
  <dt>
    Cell Type</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you specify whether the cell or cells contain data or header information. Making a row a header row gives it header styling that stands out from the data within the table.</dd>
  <dt>
    Rows Span</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you specify how many rows the cell should take up within the table. Rarely needed, but useful for certain types of table.</dd>
  <dt>
    Columns Span</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you indicate how many columns the cell should occupy within the table. You should rarely need to use this option.</dd>
  <dt>
    Background Color</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you specify a background color for the cell; clicking "Choose" opens a color picker to make it easier to find a color you like. Please try to avoid using this; the rare cases in which changing the colors in a table are acceptable will soon be covered by CSS classes.</dd>
  <dt>
    Border Color</dt>
  <dd>
    Lets you specify a border color for the cell; clicking "Choose" opens a color picker to make it easier to find a color you like. Please try to avoid using this; the rare cases in which changing the colors in a table are acceptable will soon be covered by CSS classes.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Row_options">Row options</h4>
<p>The row options submenu gives you options you may use to adjust and refine the rows in your table:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5365/table-context-row.png" style="width: 343px; height: 246px;"></p>
<p>These options are all straightforward; Insert Row Before lets you add a new row before the current cursor position in the table, while Insert Row After adds a new row below the current row. Delete Rows removes the row containing the insertion point, or all selected rows (or all rows on which you have selected cells).</p>
<h4 id="Column_options">Column options</h4>
<p>The column options submenu lets you edit the columns in your table:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5361/table-context-column.png" style="width: 344px; height: 248px;"></p>
<p>These options mirror those in the row options menu; Insert Column Before lets you add a new column to the left of the current cursor position in the table, while Insert Column After adds a new row to the right of the current location. Delete Columns removes the column containing the insertion point, or all selected columns (or all columns in which you have selected cells).</p>
<h2 id="Creating_and_editing_links">Creating and editing links</h2>
<p>Links not only among many documents, but within a single document are a crucial component to any wiki, and MDN relies heavily on them. Fortunately, links are also very easy to create, even though there are <strong>lots</strong> of ways to make them!</p>
<p>Please note that we have particular <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide#Links" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide#Links">preferred practices for linking</a>; these are described in the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Style_guide">MDN style guide</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Using_the_toolbar">Using the toolbar</h3>
<p>The most obvious way to create a link is to click the link button in the toolbar, or press Ctrl-K (Command-K on the Mac). The link button looks like this: <img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5369/link-button.png" style="width: 20px; height: 21px;">. Once you've clicked on the link button, you'll be presented with the link editor dialog, seen below:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5373/link-dialog.png" style="width: 403px; height: 394px;"></p>
<p>Here you can construct your new link. The controls in this dialog are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    Link Type</dt>
  <dd>
    The type of link you're creating. The default, URL, is for a URL somewhere on the Web, either on MDN or off-site. You may also choose "Link to anchor in the text" or "Email". The anchor link option lets you link to an anchor you've previously inserted using the Anchor button in the toolbar, by choosing it from a list. The email option lets you configure a <code>mailto:</code> URL by entering the recipient's email address, subject, and default message content. You will almost always use the URL option.</dd>
  <dt>
    Article Title Loopup / Link Text</dt>
  <dd>
    This field serves two purposes: first, you can enter the text that will be displayed to the user in the article as the link target, and also, the text entered here is used to look up articles on MDN that match what you enter, to find possible destination pages. For example, if you type "Array" in this box, you will see something like the following:</dd>
</dl>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5375/link-dialog-lookup.png" style="width: 405px; height: 395px;"></p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    Here, you can see a list of all the pages on MDN whose titles include the text you've typed. You can then scroll through the list and select one of those pages, or keep typing to narrow down the list.</dd>
  <dt>
    Attachments</dt>
  <dd>
    Alternatively, you may make the link be a link to one of the files attached to the current page by selecting the attachment from this list. This is a great way to offer links to download code samples and the like.</dd>
  <dt>
    URL</dt>
  <dd>
    Finally, the URL field lets you actually directly enter the URL; it also shows the URL of whatever you've selected in either the Article Title Lookup or Attachments menus, if you've used those. A common practice is to paste URLs to pages you're working on elsewhere on MDN, however (removing the "https://developer.mozilla.org" from the beginning, since that's implied).</dd>
</dl>
<p>Once you've got your link configured, click the OK button to insert it.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you're paying attention, you'll see that there's a second tab—Advanced—in the link editor dialog. There are no options there that we advise you to use on a regular basis, at least at this time. It's possible that in the future there will be alternate styles for links, but we will likely have special UI elements for those features when they're available.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="Linking_existing_text">Linking existing text</h3>
<p>If you have existing text that you'd like to turn into a link, you can simplify the process somewhat. Highlight the text you'd like to turn into a link before opening the link editor; this will pre-populate the Article Title Lookup field with the selected text. For example, let's say we have the following text:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You may find it useful to use JavaScript arrays when working on this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'd like to turn "arrays" into a link to the appropriate content. Just highlight that word and invoke the link editor; you'll get a dialog pre-populated like this:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5377/link-to-arrays.png" style="width: 403px; height: 393px;"></p>
<p>Here, two articles are being suggested as possible matches. "Working with Arrays" looks like a good choice, so we can choose that. This automatically fills in the URL field, so you can just click OK and the text gets turned into a link, like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You may find it useful to use JavaScript <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Obsolete_Pages/Working_with_Arrays" title="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Obsolete_Pages/Working_with_Arrays">arrays</a> when working on this project.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="Using_link_macros">Using link macros</h3>
<p>MDN makes heavy use of <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Editor_guide#Using_macros" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Editor_guide#Using_macros">macros</a> to automatically create links to the appropriate content given a term, while also styling the link according to our style guide for you. Consider this: our style guide indicates that API term names, HTML elements and attributes, CSS properties, function names, and the like should be styled with the {{HTMLElement("code")}} element (just like that, in fact). They should also, usually, be links to the appropriate page on MDN.</p>
<p>Using macros to create these links takes a little getting used to but offers many benefits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The appropriate styles are applied for you.</li>
  <li>The link is created for you—and is future-proofed against future changes in the way MDN is structured.</li>
  <li>Appropriate tooltips can be created for you, too.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are lots of these macros, and we won't look at them all here. Instead, we'll look at a few specific examples of the most common ones. For a more complete list, see the "<a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros#Creating_hyperlinks" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros#Creating_hyperlinks">Creating hyperlinks</a>" section in our <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros">Custom macros for MDN</a> guide. It's worth noting that you can always look at the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript" title="/en-US/docs/Project:Introduction_to_KumaScript">KumaScript</a> source code for any of these macros; most have comments at the top that explain how they work and what the various parameters are, if any.</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_documentation_for_APIs">Linking to documentation for APIs</h4>
<p>We have a number of extremely helpful macros for creating styled links to APIs. Here are a few of the most useful ones:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>
    {{TemplateLink("HTMLElement")}}</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts an HTML element's name, properly styled and linked. For example: <code>\{{HTMLElement("table")}}</code> yields {{HTMLElement("table")}}.</dd>
  <dt>
    {{TemplateLink("cssxref")}}</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a CSS property, at-rule, or selector's documentation in the CSS reference. For example: <code>\{{cssxref("background-color")}}</code> results in {{cssxref("background-color")}}.</dd>
  <dt>
    {{TemplateLink("domxref")}}</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts a link into the Web API Reference for a given API term. For example: <code>\{{domxref("window")}}</code> yields {{domxref("window")}} and <code>\{{domxref("window.scrollBy()")}}</code> inserts {{domxref("window.scrollBy()")}}</dd>
  <dt>
    {{TemplateLink("SVGElement")}}</dt>
  <dd>
    Inserts an SVG element's name, properly styled and linked. For example: <code>\{{SVGElement("circle")}}</code> yields {{SVGElement("circle")}}.</dd>
</dl>
<h4 id="Linking_to_sections_in_the_same_article">Linking to sections in the same article</h4>
<p>To link to a section within the same article, you can use the {{TemplateLink("anch")}} macro. The syntax is simple: <code>\{{anch("Name of destination section")}}</code>. For example, to create a link to the section on macros later in this same article, you can simply do <code>\{{anch("Using macros")}}</code>, like this: {{anch("Using macros")}}.</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_bugs">Linking to bugs</h4>
<p>You can link to a bug in Mozilla's Bugzilla database with the {{TemplateLink("bug")}} macro. This macro accepts a single parameter: the bug number to link to. For example, <code>\{{bug(765642)}}</code> looks like this: {{bug(765642)}}.</p>
<p>Similarly, you can create links to bugs in the WebKit Bugzilla instance with {{TemplateLink("WebkitBug")}}: <code>\{{webkitbug(31277)}}</code> yields {{webkitbug(31277)}}.</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_RFCs">Linking to RFCs</h4>
<p>Much of the way the Internet works at a core level is documented in RFCs. You can easily reference RFCs using the {{TemplateLink("RFC")}} macro. For example, \{{RFC(2616)}} becomes {{RFC(2616)}}.</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_information_about_XPCOM_interfaces">Linking to information about XPCOM interfaces</h4>
<p>If you're documenting Mozilla internals, being able to easily create links to XPCOM interface documentation is helpful. There are a few macros used for this.</p>
<p>Linking to the documentation for an XPCOM interface as a whole is as simple as <code>\{{interface("interfacename")}}</code>. For example, you might write:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When you need to parse or create URIs, the \{{interface("nsIIOService")}} interface can help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The result looks like this:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When you need to parse or create URIs, the {{interface("nsIIOService")}} interface can help.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you need to link to information about a specific method or attribute on an XPCOM interface, the {{TemplateLink("ifmethod")}} and {{TemplateLink("ifattribute")}} macros are for you. These accept as parameters the name of the interface and the name of the method or attribute to which you wish to reference. The {{TemplateLink("ifmethod")}} macro is particularly interesting, since it does some special formatting by adding the style guide-mandated parentheses after the method's name. For example, <code>\{{ifmethod("nsIIOService", "newURI")}}</code> results in {{ifmethod("nsIIOService", "newURI")}}. That's a case where you're being protected against possible changes in the style guide in the future!</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_Mozilla_preference_documentation">Linking to Mozilla preference documentation</h4>
<p>To insert the name of a Mozilla preference and make it link to the corresponding page in our <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/Preference_reference" title="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/Preference_reference">Preference reference</a>, use the {{TemplateLink("pref")}} macro. This accepts one parameter: the full name of the preference you wish to link to. For example, you can use <code>\{{pref("javascript.options.showInConsole")}}</code> to create this: {{pref("javascript.options.showInConsole")}}.</p>
<h4 id="Linking_to_a_Mozilla_source_file">Linking to a Mozilla source file</h4>
<p>You can link to files in Mozilla's source tree (although you probably won't do this often) using the {{TemplateLink("source")}} macro. Instead of specifying the full URL of the file, you can simply specify the path relative to the <code>/source/</code> directory. For example: \{{source("browser/Makefile.in")}} creates this link: {{source("browser/Makefile.in")}}.</p>
<p>You may also, optionally, specify alternative text to use for the link. For example, you can use \{{source("browser/Makefile.in", "the browser's makefile")}} to get the result: {{source("browser/Makefile.in", "the browser's makefile")}}.</p>

<h2 id="Creating_redirects">Creating redirects</h2>
<p>Sometimes you need to have a page that simply redirects to another page, or to a section of another page. This can be needed if a page is merged into another page sometime after its creation, for example. Fortunately, this is easy to do. You can simply click the redirect button in the toolbar, which looks like this: <img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5131/redirect.png" style="width: 17px; height: 17px;">.</p>
<p>This brings up a dialog box asking for the name of the destination document and its URL. The name isn't incredibly important; it's mostly useful if you're looking at the redirect page itself and want to know what you're redirecting to. The URL must be a full path from the base of the site, like "/en-US/docs/foo". Relative URLs will not work. However, you can specify a section within the target page using a hashmark ("#") character, such as "/destination/url/here#section_name". This lets you redirect the user straight to that section of the target page.</p>
<h2 id="Using_macros">Using macros</h2>
<p>The <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma">Kuma</a> platform on which MDN runs provides a powerful macro system, <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide">KumaScript</a>, which makes it possible to do a wide variety of things automatically. The <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide">KumaScript guide</a> provides an in-depth look at how to use macros on MDN, so this section is more of a brief overview. If you've already read the section above on {{anch("Using link macros")}}, you're already at least a little bit familiar with the concept.</p>
<p>Macros on MDN are implemented using server-executed <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript" title="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code, interpreted using <a href="http://nodejs.org/" title="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>. On top of that we have a number of libraries we've implemented that provide wiki-oriented services and features to let macros interact with the wiki platform and its contents. If you're interested in learning more, see the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_guide">KumaScript guide</a>; the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_reference" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Kuma/KumaScript_reference">KumaScript reference</a> provides details on the libraries and other KumaScript APIs we've implemented.</p>
<p>To actually use a macro, you simply enclose the call to the macro in a pair of double-braces, with its parameters, if any, enclosed in parentheses; that is:</p>
<pre>\{{macroname(parameter-list)}}</pre>
<p>A few notes about macro calls:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Macro names are case-sensitive, but some attempt is made to correct for common capitalization errors; you may use all lowercase even if the macro name uses caps within it, and you may capitalize a macro whose name normally starts with a lower-case letter.</li>
  <li>Parameters are separated by commas.</li>
  <li>If there are no parameters, you may leave out the parentheses entirely; <code>\{{macroname()}}</code> and <code>\{{macroname}}</code> are identical.</li>
  <li>Numeric parameters can be in quotes, or not. It's up to you (however, if you have a version number with multiple decimals in it, it needs to be in quotes).</li>
</ul>
<p>Macros are heavily cached; for any set of input values (both parameters and environmental values such as the URL for which the macro was run), the results are stored and reused. This means that the macro is only actually run when the inputs change.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can force all the macros on a page to be re-evaluated by force-refreshing the page in your browser (that is, a shift-reload).</p>
</div>
<p>Macros can be as simple as just inserting a larger block of text or swapping in contents from another part of MDN, or as complex as building an entire index of content by searching through parts of the site, styling the output, and adding links.</p>
<p>You can read up on our most commonly-used macros on the <a href="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros" title="/en-US/docs/Project:MDN/Contributing/Custom_macros">Custom macros</a> page; also, there's a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/templates" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/templates">complete list of all macros</a> here.</p>
<h2 id="Using_the_live_sample_system">Using the live sample system</h2>
<p>MDN supports turning sample code displayed in articles into running samples the reader can look at in action. These live samples can include HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript in any combination.</p>
<h3 id="How_the_system_works">How the system works</h3>
<p>The live sample system gathers up all the code in a group, merges it together into one HTML file, and then renders that HTML in an {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}.</p>
<p>A "group," in this context, can be defined in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>All {{HTMLElement("pre")}} blocks following a given header, but before the next header. The group is identified by the ID of the header under which the code is located.</li>
  <li>All {{HTMLElement("pre")}} blocks inside a given block. The group is identified by the enclosing block's ID.</li>
</ol>
<p>The {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} uses a special URL to fetch the sample code for a given group: <code>http://<em>url-of-page</em>$samples/<em>group-id</em></code>, where <code>group-id</code> is the ID of the header under which the code is located, or of the block in which the code is located. The resulting frame is sandboxed, secure, and may do anything that works on the Web (as long as it forwards the point of the content, of course; random stuff running on MDN will be removed).</p>
<p>Each {{HTMLElement("pre")}} block containing code for the sample has a class on it that indicates whether it's HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code; these are "brush: html", "brush: css", and "brush: js". These classes must be on the corresponding blocks of code so that the wiki can use them correctly; fortunately, these are added for you automatically when you use the syntax highlighter features in the editor's toolbar.</p>
<p>Using the live sample system is deceptively easy. There are lots of options available, and we'll try to break things down to look at them a bit at a time.</p>
<h3 id="Turning_snippets_into_live_samples">Turning snippets into live samples</h3>
<p>One common use case is to take existing code snippets already shown on MDN and turn them into live samples.</p>
<h4 id="Prepare_the_code_samples">Prepare the code samples</h4>
<p>The first step is to either add code snippets or ensure that existing ones are ready to be used as live samples. This is simply a matter of ensuring that each piece of code is both properly marked as to which language it is, and is in a {{HTMLElement("pre")}} block. Most of the time, this has already been done, but it's always worth double-checking to be sure each piece of code is configured with the correct syntax. Next to the "PRE" icon in the toolbar is a drop-down menu icon under which are the various languages for which MDN has syntax highlighting available. Setting the syntax highlighting language for the block also correlates it with a language for the purposes of the live sample system.</p>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> You may have more than one block for each language; they are all concatenated together. This lets you have a chunk of code, followed by an explanation of how it works, then another chunk, and so forth. This makes it even easier to produce tutorials and the like that utilize live samples interspersed with explanatory text.</p>
</div>
<p>So make sure the {{HTMLElement("pre")}} blocks for your HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript code are each configured correctly for that language's syntax highlighting, and you're good to go.</p>
<h4 id="Insert_the_live_sample_frame">Insert the live sample frame</h4>
<p>Once the code is in place and properly configured to identify each block's language, you need to insert the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}}. To do so, you can click the "Insert Live Code Sample iFrame" button in the toolbar; it looks like this: <img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5383/insert-live-sample-btn.png" style="width: 19px; height: 18px;">. Upon clicking this button, you're presented with a dialog box for configuring your live sample frame:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5385/sample-finder.png" style="width: 405px; height: 358px;"></p>
<p>Under "Document", you enter the name of the article that contains the sample you wish to embed. By default, it's the article you're currently editing, but you may choose an article elsewhere on MDN, too. This makes it possible to reuse samples on multiple pages if needed.</p>
<p>The "Sections in Document" menu presents the sections in the article from which you may choose to pull a sample.</p>
<p>Clicking the OK button generates and inserts the macro call that will create your frame for you. That macro is called {{TemplateLink("EmbedLiveSample")}}. You can, of course, choose to type the macro out by hand. It takes up to four parameters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ID of the header or enclosing block from which to draw the code. This isn't the same thing as the header text—by default, the ID for headers is the header text with spaces turned into underscores, and certain non-ASCII characters are encoded. The best way to be sure you have the ID right is to look at the URL of the section in the page's table of contents.</li>
  <li>The width of the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} to create. This is optional; a reasonable default width will be used if you omit this or if it's zero. Note that if you want to use a specific width, you <strong>must</strong> also specify the height parameter.</li>
  <li>The height of the {{HTMLElement("iframe")}} to create.This is optional; a reasonable default height will be used if you omit this or if it's zero. Note that if you want to use a specific height, you <strong>must</strong> also specify the width parameter. If you use only one of them, the default frame size is used.</li>
  <li>The URL of a screenshot that shows what the live sample should look like. This is optional, but can be useful for new technologies that may not work in the user's browser, so they can see what the sample would look like if it were supported by their browser. If you include this parameter, the screenshot is shown next to the live sample, with appropriate headings.</li>
  <li>The slug of the page containing the sample; this is optional, and if it's not provided, the sample is pulled from the same page on which the macro is used.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also provide a link that opens the live sample as a new document rather than embedding it inline in your article. To do that, use the {{TemplateLink("LiveSampleLink")}} macro, which accepts two parameters:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The ID of the header or enclosing block from which to draw the code. This isn't the same thing as the header text—by default, the ID for headers is the header text with spaces turned into underscores. The best way to be sure you have the ID right is to look at the URL of the section in the page's table of contents.</li>
  <li>A string to use as the link text.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's worth noting that in many cases, you should be able to add the {{TemplateLink("EmbedLiveSample")}} or {{TemplateLink("LiveSampleLink")}} macro to pages with little or no additional work! As long as the sample can be identified by a header's ID or is in a block with an ID you can use, simply adding the macro should do the job.</p>
<h3 id="Adding_a_new_live_sample">Adding a new live sample</h3>
<p>If you're writing a new page, and want to insert code that you want to present as a live sample, even more of the work can be done for you by the editor! Simply click on the "Insert Code Sample Template" button in the toolbar, which looks like this: <img alt="" src="/files/4265/live-sample-button.png" style="width: 21px; height: 19px;">. Clicking that button presents a simple dialog asking you to name your live sample:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/5387/insert-live-sample-template.png" style="width: 251px; height: 155px;"></p>
<p>Enter the name of the sample; this is used as the heading for the sample. In the example below, we've entered "Live sample demo" in this box.</p>
<h3 id="Live_sample_demo" name="Live_sample_demo">Finding samples that need updating</h3>
<p>When looking for existing samples to update, there are three main kinds of updating you may wish to do:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Turn an existing non-live example snippet into a live sample.</li>
  <li>Correct bugs in an existing live sample.</li>
  <li>Improve an existing live sample, or update a sample based on technology changes.</li>
</ol>
<div class="note">
  <p><strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> If you find an article that has samples in need of being updated to use the live sample system, please add the tag "NeedsLiveSample" to the page.</p>
</div>
<h4 id="Finding_samples_to_turn_into_live_samples">Finding samples to turn into live samples</h4>
<p>MDN has lots of older examples that don't yet use the live sample system. Our goal is to update most or all of these to be live samples. This will improve consistency and usability. You will almost certainly find many of these as you use MDN on a daily basis; however, how can you find them if you're specifically looking for them to update? Unfortunately, there's not an easy way to do that. But there are some guidelines you can follow to help track them down:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Start by looking at this <a href="/en-US/docs/tag/NeedsLiveSample" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/tag/NeedsLiveSamples">list of pages tagged with "NeedsLiveSample"</a>. These are pages that users have marked as needing updating. You should add this tag yourself, if you see a page that needs to be updated to use live samples but don't have time to fix right away.</li>
  <li>Browse through documentation trees that are likely to include examples, such as the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide" title="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide">JavaScript Guide</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML" title="/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML documentation</a>, and <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" title="/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">CSS reference</a>.</li>
  <li>Search for terms like "<a href="/en-US/search?q=example" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=example">example</a>" or "<a href="/en-US/search?q=sample" title="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/search?q=sample">sample</a>" and look through the results for pages to update.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Live_sample_demo" name="Live_sample_demo">Live sample demo</h3>
<p>As you can see here, the live sample template button has created not only the main heading ("Live sample demo"), but also subheadings for our HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content. You're not limited to one block of each; in addition, they don't even need to be in any particular order. Mix and match!</p>
<p>You may choose to delete any of these you wish; if you don't need any script, just delete that heading and its {{HTMLElement("pre")}} block.</p>
<p>Now that the template has been inserted, we can put in some code, and even some explanatory text.</p>
<h4 id="HTML">HTML</h4>
<p>This HTML creates a paragraph and some blocks to help us position and style a message.</p>
<pre class="brush: html">&lt;p&gt;A simple example of the live sample system in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="box"&gt;
  &lt;div id="item"&gt;Hello world!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>
<h4 id="CSS">CSS</h4>
<p>The CSS code styles the box as well as the text inside it.</p>
<pre class="brush: css">.box {
  width: 200px;
  height: 100px;
  border: 2px solid blue;
  border-radius: 6px;
  background-color: #ffaabb;
}

#item {
  width: 100%;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-align: center;
}
</pre>
<h4 id="JavaScript">JavaScript</h4>
<p>This code is very simple. All it does is change the font size of the "Hello world!" message.</p>
<pre class="brush: js">var el = document.getElementById("item");
el.style.fontSize = "3em";
</pre>
<p>{{ EmbedLiveSample('Live_sample_demo') }}</p>
<p> </p>
