<p>Syntax specifies the required combination and sequence of {{Glossary("character","characters")}} making up correctly structured code. Syntax varies from language to language (e.g., syntax is different in {{Glossary("HTML")}} and {{Glossary("JavaScript")}}). Syntax applies both to programming languages (commands to the computer) and markup languages (document structure information).</p>

<p>Syntax only governs ordering and structure; the instructions must also be <em>meaningful</em>, which is the province of {{Glossary("semantics")}}.</p>

<p>Code must have correct syntax in order to {{Glossary("compile")}} correctly, otherwise a {{Glossary("syntax error")}} occurs. Even small errors, like a missing parenthesis, can keep source code from compiling.</p>

<p>Frameworks are said to have a "clean" syntax if they produce simple, readable, concise results. If a codebase uses "a lot of syntax", it requires more characters to achieve the same functionality.</p>
