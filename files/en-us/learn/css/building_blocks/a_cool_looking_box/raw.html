<h2 id="Starting_point">Starting point</h2>

<p>To get this assessment started, you should:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Make local copies of the starting <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/index.html">HTML</a> and <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/blob/master/css/styling-boxes/cool-information-box-start/style.css">CSS</a> — save them as <code>index.html</code> and <code>style.css</code> in a new directory.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Alternatively, you could use a site like <a class="external external-icon" href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a> to do your assessment. You could paste the HTML and fill in the CSS into one of these online editors. If the online editor you are using doesn't have a separate CSS panel, feel free to put it in a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code> element in the head of the document.</p>

<h2 id="Project_brief">Project brief</h2>

<p>Your task is to create a cool, fancy box and explore the fun we can have with CSS.</p>

<h3 id="General_tasks">General tasks</h3>

<ul>
 <li>Apply the CSS to the HTML.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Styling_the_box">Styling the box</h3>

<p>We'd like you to style the provided {{htmlelement("p")}}, giving it the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A reasonable width for a large button, say around 200 pixels.</li>
 <li>A reasonable height for a large button, centering the text vertically in the process.</li>
 <li>Centered text.</li>
 <li>A slight increase in font size, to around 17-18 pixel computed style. Use rems. Write a comment about how you worked out the value.</li>
 <li>A base color for the design. Give the box this color as its background color.</li>
 <li>The same color for the text; make it readable using a black text shadow.</li>
 <li>A fairly subtle border radius.</li>
 <li>A 1-pixel solid border with a color similar to the base color, but a slightly darker shade.</li>
 <li>A linear semi-transparent black gradient that goes toward the bottom right corner. Make it completely transparent at the start, gradiating to around 0.2 opacity by 30% along, and remaining at the same color until the end.</li>
 <li>Multiple box shadows. Give it one standard box shadow to make the box look slightly raised off the page. The other two should be inset box shadows — a semi-transparent white shadow near the top left and a semi-transparent black shadow near the bottom right — to add to the nice raised 3D look of the box.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Example">Example</h2>

<p>The following screenshot shows an example of what the finished design could look like:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/13148/fancy-box.png" style="display: block; height: 76px; margin: 0px auto; width: 228px;"></p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

If you are self-learning, then you can get the marking guide fairly easily by asking on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/a-cool-looking-box-assessment/24685">discussion thread about this exercise</a>, or in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a> IRC channel on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">Mozilla IRC</a>. Try the exercise first — there is nothing to be gained by cheating!</p>
