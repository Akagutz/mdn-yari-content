<p class="summary">If you have worked through this module then you will have already covered the basics of what you need to know to do CSS layout today, and to work with older CSS as well. This task will test some of your knowledge by way of developing a simple webpage layout using a variety of techniques.</p>

<h2 id="Project_Brief">Project Brief</h2>

<p>You have been provided with some raw HTML, basic CSS, and images — now you need to create a layout for the design, which should look just like the image below.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16076/layout-task-complete.png" style="height: 706px; width: 1000px;"></p>

<h3 id="Basic_Setup">Basic Setup</h3>

<p>You can download the HTML, CSS, and a set of six images <a href="https://github.com/mdn/learning-area/tree/master/css/css-layout/fundamental-layout-comprehension">here</a>.</p>

<p>Save the HTML document and stylesheet into a directory on your computer, and add the images into a folder named <code>images</code>. Opening the <code>index.html</code> file in a browser should give you a page with basic styling but no layout, which should look something like the image seen below.</p>

<p>This starting point has all of the content of your layout as displayed by the browser in normal flow.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16075/layout-task-start.png" style="height: 675px; width: 1000px;"></p>

<h3 id="Your_tasks">Your tasks</h3>

<p>You now need to implement your layout. The tasks you need to achieve are:</p>

<ol>
 <li>To display the navigation items in a row, with an equal amount of space between the items.</li>
 <li>The navigation bar should scroll with the content and then become stuck at the top of the viewport when it reaches it.</li>
 <li>The image that is inside the article should have text wrapped around it.</li>
 <li>The {{htmlelement("article")}} and {{htmlelement("aside")}} elements should display as a two column layout. The columns should be a flexible size so that if the browser window shrinks smaller the columns become narrower.</li>
 <li>The photographs should display as a two column grid with a 1 pixel gap between the images.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will not need to edit the HTML in order to achieve this layout and the techniques you should use are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Positioning</li>
 <li>Float</li>
 <li>Flexbox</li>
 <li>CSS Grid Layout</li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few ways in which you could achieve some of these tasks, and there often isn’t a single right or wrong way to do things. Try a few different approaches and see which works best. Make notes as you experiment, and you can always discuss your approach in the discussion thread for this exercise or in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a> IRC channel.</p>

<h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>

<p>If you are following this assessment as part of an organized course, you should be able to give your work to your teacher/mentor for marking. If you are self-learning, then you can get the marking guide fairly easily by asking on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/fundamental-layout-comprehension-assessment/29982">discussion thread about this exercise</a>, or in the <a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a> IRC channel on <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">Mozilla IRC</a>. Try the exercise first — there is nothing to be gained by cheating!</p>
