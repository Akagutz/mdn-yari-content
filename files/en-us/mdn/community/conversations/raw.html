<div>{{MDNSidebar}}</div><p class="summary">The "work" of MDN happens on the MDN site, but the "community" also happens through (asynchronous) discussion and (synchronous) online chat and meetings.</p>

<h2 id="Asynchronous_discussions">Asynchronous discussions</h2>

<p>To share information and have ongoing discussions, <a href="https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/mdn">MDN has its own category ("MDN") in the Mozilla Discourse forum</a>. Use this category for all topics related to MDN, including documentation content creation, translation, and maintenance; MDN platform development; and planning, goal-setting, and progress tracking.</p>

<ul>
 <li>To join Mozilla's Discourse, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/signing-up-and-logging-in/16017">Signing up and logging in</a>; if you have a Mozilla LDAP account, you can use that instead of "Login with email".</li>
 <li>To subscribe to the MDN category, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/subscribing-to-categories-and-topics/16024">Subscribing to categories and topics</a>.</li>
 <li>(Optional) If you prefer to interact with Discourse primarily by email, see <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/t/mailman-mode/15279">Set up a mailing list experience for yourself</a>. You can start a discussion in Discourse by sending an email message to: <a href="mailto://mdn@mozilla-community.org">mdn@mozilla-community.org</a>. If you use Discourse via email, you can reply to a message by replying to the notification email that you receive. If you want to intersperse comments inline within a reply, please put two carriage-returns before and after your inline chunks, so that Discourse parses them correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Historical_archives">Historical archives</h3>

<p>Prior to June 2017, MDN-related discussions took place in mailings lists that were gatewayed and archived with Google groups. If you want to search these past discussions, you can look at the Google groups corresponding to the old mailing lists. (Yes, we know these names are overlapping and confusing. Historical accident. Sorry about that.)</p>

<h2 id="Chat_in_IRC">Chat in IRC</h2>

<p> </p>

<p>Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is our preferred method for day-to-day chat and real-time discussions among community members. We use a few channels on the server irc.mozilla.org for discussions related to MDN.</p>

<dl>
 <dt><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdn">#mdn</a></dt>
 <dd>This channel is our primary channel for discussing the content of MDN. We talk about writing, organization of content, and so on. We also have "water cooler" conversations here—it's a way our community can keep in touch and just hang out. This is also the place to talk about other aspects of MDN (other than development of the platform), such as Demo Studio, profiles, and so on.</dd>
 <dt><a href="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev" title="irc://irc.mozilla.org/mdndev">#mdndev</a></dt>
 <dd>This channel is where our development team—the people that write the code that makes MDN work—hangs out and discusses their day-to-day work. You're welcome to join in and either participate in the development or simply ask questions about issues you see with the software.</dd>
</dl>

<p>These channels are most likely to be active during weekdays in North America.</p>

<p>You may want to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">learn more about IRC</a> and use an installable IRC client such as <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/" title="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/chatzilla/">ChatZilla</a>. It is implemented as a Firefox add-on, which makes it quick and easy to install and use. If you're not familiar with IRC, an easy way to join is using a web-based IRC client such as <a href="https://chat.mibbit.com/">Mibbit</a>. Here are the direct links to the <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org%3A%2B6697&amp;channel=%23mdn">#mdn</a> and <a href="http://chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.mozilla.org%3A%2B6697&amp;channel=%23mdndev">#mdndev</a> channels on Mibbit.</p>

<h2 id="Join_our_meetings_(and_other_events)">Join our meetings (and other events)</h2>

<p>The MDN team holds a number of regular meetings that are open to the MDN community. See the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/MDN/Meetings">MDN Meetings</a> page on the Mozilla wiki for details on the schedule, agendas and notes, and info on how to join.</p>
