<p><span class="seoSummary">To edit content on MDN, you need an MDN profile. You don't need a profile if you only want to read and search the MDN docs. This guide will help you set up your MDN profile.</span></p>

<div class="moreinfo"><strong>Why does MDN need my email address?</strong><br>
<br>
Your email address is used for account recovery and, if needed, by MDN administrators to contact you about your account or your activity on the site.<br>
<br>
In addition, you can sign up for notifications (such as <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Watch_a_page">when specific pages are changed</a>) and messages (for example, if you opt to join our beta testing team, you might receive emails about new features that need testing).<br>
<br>
Your email address is never displayed on MDN and will be used only in accordance with our <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/websites/">privacy policy</a>.<br>
 
<div class="note">If you log in to MDN via GitHub, and you use a "noreply" email address on GitHub, you will <em>not</em> receive messages (including notifications when you subscribe to pages) from MDN.</div>

 <li>At the top of every page on MDN you'll find a button labeled <strong>Sign in</strong>. Point your mouse at this (or tap on it, if you're on a mobile device) to display a list of the authentication services we support for signing in to MDN.2. Select a service to sign in with. Currently, only GitHub is available. Note that if you select GitHub, a link to your GitHub profile will be included on your public MDN profile page.  <img alt="where users enter sign-up details" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16954/2019-11-17.png" style="height: 848px; width: 1896px;"></li>
 <li>Follow GitHub's prompts to connect your account to MDN. <img alt="where users login or create there account" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16956/2019-11-17_3.png" style="height: 879px; width: 1902px;"></li>
 <li>Once the authentication service returns you to MDN, you'll be prompted to enter a username and email address. <em>Your username will be displayed publicly to credit you for the work you've done. Do not use your email address as your username</em><strong>. </strong><strong><img alt="where users login or create there account" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/16955/2019-11-17_2.png" style="height: 862px; width: 1870px;"></strong></li>
 <li>Click <strong>Create my MDN profile</strong>.</li>
 <li>If the email address you specified in step 4 isn't the same one you use with the authentication service, please check your email and click the link in the confirmation email we send you.</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it! You've got an MDN account, and you can immediately edit pages!</p>

<p>You can click on your name at the top of any MDN page to see your public profile. From there, you can click <strong>Edit</strong> to make changes or additions to your profile.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>New usernames can't contain spaces or the "@" character. Keep in mind that your username will be displayed publicly to identify the work you've done.</p>
