<p class="summary">This page tries to track ongoing documentation work for MDN Developer Phone docs. Feel free to contribute!</p>

<h2 id="Summary">Summary</h2>

<p>{{DocStatus("/en-US/docs/Archive/B2G_OS", '[]', '', '', '', '', '["Firefox OS"]')}}</p>

<h2 id="General_plan">General plan</h2>

<p>Every day on mailing lists such as dev-b2g, we get a huge number of e-mails asking for support information about B2G/Firefox OS, installing/updating it on various devices, unbricking phones, carrier and device-specific quirks, etc. This requires a lot of effort to keep the developer community happy, and it would be really useful to put together a series of pages that would hopefully cover all the different problems developers are coming up against when trying to update the B2G software on all the different available devices that are capable of running Firefox OS.</p>

<p>We do have an <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide">initial guide</a>, but it was never completed, and has not been updated for more recent devices.</p>

<p>But this currently covers only the Geeksphone and ZTE OPEN. There are a number of other devices not covered here, and a possible number of other carrier/device/B2G version quirks that ought to be covered. <span class="seoSummary">The aim of this project is to scope out, collect and publish all information about the various Mozilla-sponsored Firefox OS developer phones, in an easy to navigate format.</span></p>

<p>The following types of pages will need to be produced:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Landing pages</li>

</ul>

<h4 id="Landing_pages">Landing pages</h4>

<p>The following landing page will need to be produced:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A page primarily consisting of a table of all "developer phone" devices that are or have been available, with information about them provided in some form.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="User_guides">User guides</h4>

<p>The following user guide pages will be needed, as sub-pages of the table:</p>

<ul>

<h3 id="Existing_content">Existing content</h3>

<p>The article <a href="/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide">Developer phone guide</a> exists but is about a very very old device, and does not cover any newer devices. This page should be replaced with the new landing page listing all available developer phone models.</p>
