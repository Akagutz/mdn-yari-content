<p>This page tries to track ongoing documentation work in the MDN <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary">Glossary</a>. Feel free to contribute!</p>

<p>{{DocStatus('Glossary','[]', 'March 1, 2014', '', '', '', '["Navigation", "WebMechanics", "Search", "Credibility", "Security", "Composing", "Remixing", "Design","Accessibility", "CodingScripting", "Infrastructure", "Sharing", "Collaborating", "Community", "Privacy", "OpenPractices","Disambiguation"]')}}</p>

<h2 id="Current_priorities">Current priorities</h2>

<h3 id="Technical_Review">Technical Review</h3>

<p>There are a lot of articles flagged for technical review. You can check if they are technically correct and correct them and/or remove the flag as appropriate.</p>

<h3 id="Editorial_Review">Editorial Review</h3>

<p>Articles need to be correctly formatted and spell-checked. <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Class">Here</a> is an example of a well-formatted entry.</p>

<h3 id="Cut_longer_articles">Cut longer articles</h3>

<p>If an article is too long, it needs to be reduced as per guidelines <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_a_new_entry_in_the_Glossary">here</a>. If you think a long article is particularly well written and deserves to be preserved, discuss it with us, on the <a href="https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/c/mdn">MDN discussion forum</a>. It can be moved to the appropriate area of MDN if it's deserving of it's own place on the site.</p>

<h3 id="General_check_of_completeness">General check of completeness</h3>

<p>There are a lot of articles. We should check to see if they need content and tag them appropriately.</p>

<h3 id="Use_the_Glossary_macro">Use the Glossary macro</h3>

<p>Articles in the Glossary Area, the Learning Area and MDN in general should use the Glossary macro (where appropriate). You can learn more about the glossary macro <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Write_a_new_entry_in_the_Glossary#How_to_use_the_.7B.7BGlossary.7D.7D_macro">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="How_to_improve_the_content">How to improve the content</h2>

<h3 id="Tagging_standard">Tagging standard</h3>

<ul>
 <li>If pages are related to a given technology, they should be tagged with that <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Howto/Tag#Topic">technology name</a>.</li>
 <li>If pages need any type of work, a "<strong>Need*</strong>" tag should be added.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="Link_the_glossary">Link the glossary</h3>

<p>While browsing and editing MDN, you can easly link any term to the glossary by using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Template:Glossary">Glossary</a> macro.</p>

<p>It takes up to three possible parameters:</p>

<ol>
 <li>The term to link to (note that terms are case insensitive)</li>
 <li>An alternate text to display (an expression identical to the term, a plural version, etc.)</li>
 <li>A flag indicating if the link must be displayed as a regular link (<code>1</code>) or as a soft link (<code>0</code>, the default)</li>
</ol>

  </tr>

<h3 id="Writing_a_term_definition">Writing a term definition</h3>

<p>A term definition page must have three clear sections:</p>

<ol>
 <li>A summary that shortly defines the term (one to two sentences at most)</li>
 <li>An in-depth definition that provides all the necessary details to understand what the term covers</li>
 <li>A "Learn more" section that provides various links to dig deeper in the area covered by this term</li>
</ol>

<p>The content of a term definition must be written assuming the reader has no specific knowledge about the term and its usage. Use simple and straightforward English. Try to avoid as many technicalities as possible (it's not always possible but try to simplify).</p>

<p>Please remember that while gathering information from other sites is a good thing, it isn't good practice to copy and paste passages (or even entire articles) from them (otherwise we could just link to them).</p>
