<h3 id="How_to_localize_this_page">How to localize this page</h3>

<p>This English page does not contain any localization status information. It is a "parent" page for translated status pages. To see the localization status for prioritized pages in your favorite language, select your language in the <strong>Languages</strong> menu (upper right corner of the page, next to the <strong>Edit</strong> button).</p>

<p>If your language is not on the menu, you can create a page for it by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Make sure that translated pages exist for the topical status pages (<a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/Accessibility">Accessibility</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/API">API</a>, <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status/Apps">Apps</a>, and so on). If they don't exist, do the following:

  <ol>
   <li>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/mdn/kumascript">Kumascript</a> project on Github, and edit the file <code>/blob/master/macros/LocalizationStatusInSection.ejs</code> to add translated strings in your language.</li>
   <li>Also translate the string "Priority articles" in <code>/blob/master/macros/LocalizationStatusl10nPriority.ejs</code> the same way that you translated it in the first file.</li>
   <li>Submit the changes in these two files as a Github pull request (PR). <strong>Note:</strong> Keep your PR small; PRs for many strings in many files are difficult to review, and will be rejected.</li>
   <li>Wait for your PR to be accepted, merged, and pushed into production.</li>
   <li>Create child pages of the main <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Doc_status">Doc status</a> page, one for each of the topic sections, using the <code>LocalizationInSection</code> macro to generate the body of the pages. (See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Structures/Macros">Macros</a> for information about using them.)</li>
  </ol>
 </li>
 <li>From this English page, select <strong>Add a translation</strong> in the <strong>Languages</strong> menu, and select your language in the page that appears. See <a href="/en-US/docs/MDN/Contribute/Localize/Translating_pages">Translating MDN pages</a> for more information.</li>
 <li>In your translated page, substitute the locale code that corresponds to your language into the macro call above. For example, <code>\{{LocalizationStatusl10nPriority("de")}}</code> for German.</li>
 <li><em>Be sure to delete this section from the translated page.</em></li>
</ol>
