<p>When working with <a href="/en/Mercurial" title="en/Mercurial">Mercurial</a>, it is often nice to publish your changes on a server as a backup or so others can examine and work with them. If you have Level 1 <a class="link-https" href="https://www.mozilla.org/hacking/commit-access-policy/#Summary" title="https://www.mozilla.org/hacking/commit-access-policy/#Summary">commit access</a> or higher, then you should have an LDAP account which allows you to push to user repos in the <a class="link-https" href="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/" title="https://hg.mozilla.org/users/"><code>/users</code></a> directory of <code>hg.mozilla.org</code>.</p>

<p>See the<a href="https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/hgmo/managing-repos.html"> instructions</a>.</p>
