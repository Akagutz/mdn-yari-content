<p>There's an <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/.lldbinit"><code>.lldbinit</code></a> file in the Mozilla source tree, which applies recommended settings and includes a few type summaries and Mozilla-specific debugging commands via the lldbutils module (see <a href="http://mxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/python/lldbutils/README.txt">python/lldbutils/README.txt</a>). For information about available features see the links above and <a href="http://mcc.id.au/blog/2014/01/lldb-gecko">Using LLDB to debug Gecko</a> blog post.</p>
<p>The in-tree <code>.lldbinit</code> should be loaded automatically in most cases when runnning lldb from the command line (e.g. using <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/mach"><code>mach</code></a>), but <strong>not</strong> when using XCode. See <a href="/en-US/docs/Debugging_on_Mac_OS_X">Debugging on Mac OS X</a> for information on setting up XCode.</p>

 <p>LLDB warning: Xcode 5 only comes with lldb (gdb is gone). The introduction and use of UNIFIED_SOURCES in the source starting around November 2013 has broken the default LLDB configuration so that it will not manage to resolve breakpoints in files that are build using UNIFIED_SOURCES (the breakpoints will be listed as "pending", and lldb will not stop at them). To fix this add the following to your $HOME/.lldbinit file:</p>
 <pre class="eval"># Mozilla's use of UNIFIED_SOURCES to include multiple source files into a
# single compiled file breaks lldb breakpoint setting. This works around that.
# See http://lldb.llvm.org/troubleshooting.html for more.
settings set target.inline-breakpoint-strategy always
</pre>
 <p>Restart Xcode/lldb and restart your debugging session. If that still doesn't fix things then try closing Xcode/lldb, doing a clobber build, reopening Xcode/lldb, and restarting your debugging session.</p>

<p>You can attach to Firefox with following command:</p>
<pre class="eval">(lldb) process attach --name firefox
</pre>
<p>Some versions of lldb causes crashes after attaching to Firefox.</p>

<p>To start Firefox under the debugger, run <code>lldb</code> followed by "--", followed by the command line you'd like to run, like this:</p>
<pre>$ lldb -- obj-ff-dbg/dist/Nightly.app/Contents/MacOS/firefox-bin -no-remote -profile /path/to/profile</pre>
<p>Then set breakpoints you need and start the process:</p>
<pre>(lldb) breakpoint set --name nsInProcessTabChildGlobal::InitTabChildGlobal
Breakpoint created: 1: name = 'nsInProcessTabChildGlobal::InitTabChildGlobal', locations = 0 (pending)
