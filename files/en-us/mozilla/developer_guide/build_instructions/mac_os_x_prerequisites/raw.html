<p>This document will help you get set up to build Firefox on your own computer. Getting set up won't be difficult, but it can take a while - we need to download a lot of bytes! Even on a fast connection, this can take ten to fifteen minutes of work, spread out over an hour or two.</p>

<p>The details are further down this page, but this quick-start guide should get you up and running:</p>

<h2 id="One-Line_Setup_Try_This_First!">One-Line Setup (Try This First!)</h2>

<p>Xcode is a prequisite to build Firefox an you will need administrator permissions on your machine to install it.  You can verify that you have these permission in System Preferences -&gt; Users &amp; Groups.) You will also need:</p>

<ul>
 <li>an Apple ID (to install <code>Xcode</code>)</li>
 <li>1 hour (to download and install <code>Xcode</code>, which is large)</li>
 <li>macOS SDK headers</li>
</ul>

<p>See "The Details", "Install Apple-distributed developer tools" below for more information on install prerequsites.</p>

<h3 class="heading-tertiary" id="Getting_the_source">Getting the source</h3>

<p>If you don’t have one yet, create a "<code>src</code>" directory for yourself under your home directory:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir src &amp;&amp; cd src</code></pre>

<p>Next <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py">download the bootstrap.py script</a> and save it in the <code>src/</code> directory created above.</p>

<p>And finally, in your terminal from above start the bootstrapper like this:</p>

<pre><code>python bootstrap.py</code></pre>

<p>... and follow the prompts. This will use mercurial to checkout the source code. If you prefer to work with git, use this command instead:</p>

<pre><code>python bootstrap.py --vcs=git</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have Homebrew or Ports installed - software package managers that will let us install some programs we'll need - you'll be asked to pick one. Either will work, but most Mozilla developers use Homebrew.</p>

<p>If you don't let the bootstrap.py script clone the source for you make sure you do it manually afterwards before moving onto the next step.</p>

<h3 class="heading-tertiary highlight-spanned" id="Build_Firefox!"><span class="highlight-span">Build Firefox!</span></h3>

<p>Now we tie it all together. In your terminal window, <code>cd</code> to your source directory as before and type</p>

<pre class="line-numbers  language-html"><code class="language-html">cd mozilla-unified

./mach bootstrap

./mach build</code></pre>

<p>The <code>./mach bootstrap</code> step is a catch-all for any dependencies not covered in this documentation. If you are working on Firefox frontends or building Firefox without any changes, select <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Artifact_builds">artifact builds</a> in the first question in <code>./mach bootstrap</code>.  Artifact builds will complete more quickly!  Artifact builds are unsuitable for those working on C++ code.</p>

<p>You’re on your way. Don’t be discouraged if this takes a while; it takes some time even on the fastest modern machines and as much as two hours or more on older hardware. Firefox is pretty big, because the Web is big.</p>

<h2 id="The_details">The details</h2>

<p>If you run into problems, see the <a href="/en/Developer_Guide/Mozilla_build_FAQ" title="en/Mozilla_Build_FAQ">Mozilla Build Frequently Asked Questions</a> or the rest of the <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions" title="en/Build_Documentation">Mozilla build documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Once your build environment is complete, proceed to Step 3 below.</p>

<h2 id="Firefox_Quick_Start" name="Firefox_Quick_Start">Build steps (Details)</h2>

<p>Building on macOS is divided into the following steps:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Install Apple-distributed developer tools</li>
 <li>Install supplementary build tools</li>
 <li>Obtain a copy of the Mozilla source code</li>
 <li>Configure the Mozilla source tree to suit your needs</li>
 <li>Build Firefox</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1._Install_Apple-distributed_developer_tools">1. Install Apple-distributed developer tools</h3>

<p>You first need to install Xcode, for which you have two options:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If you want to avoid giving Apple your credit card details to obtain a Apple developer subscription you can download Xcode from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/">More Downloads for Apple Developers</a> page. Download the latest <strong>stable</strong> (non-beta) version of Xcode, open Xcode.xip, and then <strong>before</strong> running the extracted Xcode.app, <strong>move it from the download folder to /Applications</strong>. (Running it from another location may screw up various build paths, homebrew builds, etc. Fix by running <code>sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app</code>)</li>
 <li>Use the App Store.</li>
</ul>

<p>Open /Applications/Xcode.app and let it do its initial first run and setup stuff.</p>

<p>Install the Xcode command line tools by running <code>xcode-select --install</code> in your terminal.</p>

<h3 id="1.2_Get_the_macOS_10.11_SDK">1.2 Get the macOS 10.11 SDK</h3>

<p>Firefox currently requires the macOS 10.11 SDK to build. There are various issues when building with other SDKs. To get the 10.11 SDK, first download Xcode 7.3.1 from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/">More Downloads for Apple Developers</a> page. Once downloaded, extract Xcode 7.3.1 from the .dmg. In Terminal, navigate to the directory with the newly extracted Xcode application and run the following:</p>

<pre>mkdir -p <span>$HOME/SDK-archive</span>
<span>cp -a Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/</span>MacOSX10.11.sdk<span> $HOME/SDK-archive/</span>MacOSX10.11.sdk
</pre>

<p>Then in your .mozconfig files add:</p>

<pre><span>ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=$HOME/SDK-archive/</span>MacOSX10.11.sdk</pre>

<h3 id="1.3_Install_the_SDK_headers">1.3 Install the SDK headers</h3>

<p>As of Xcode 10, the needed SDK headers are not installed by default. To install them, first download the "Command Line Tools (OS X 10.11) for Xcode 7.3.1" from the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/download/more/">More Downloads for Apple Developers</a> page. Once downloaded, run the installer to install the required command line tools and SDK headers. (Xcode 11 does not have a means to install these headers.)</p>

<h3 id="2._Install_supplementary_build_tools">2. Install supplementary build tools</h3>

<p>Mozilla's source tree requires a number of third-party tools and applications to build it. You will need to install these before you can build anything.</p>

<p>You have the choice over how to install all these components. You can use a package manager like Homebrew or Ports. Or, you can obtain, compile, and install them individually. For simplicity and to save your time, using a package manager is recommended. The following sections describe how to install the packages using existing package managers. Choose whatever package manager you prefer.</p>

<h4 id="2.1a_Install_dependencies_via_Homebrew">2.1a Install dependencies via Homebrew</h4>

<p><a class="external" href="http://brew.sh/" title="Homebrew site">Homebrew</a> is "the missing package manager for macOS." It provides a simple command-line interface to install packages, typically by compiling them from source.</p>

<p>The first step is to install Homebrew. See <a href="https://brew.sh/">https://brew.sh/</a></p>

<p>Once you have Homebrew installed, you'll need to run the following:</p>

<pre><code>brew install yasm mercurial gawk ccache python</code>
</pre>

<p>You will also need Autoconf 2.13, but the core Homebrew repository will install a newer version by default, so you need to specify the version when installing it:</p>

<pre><code>brew install autoconf@2.13</code>
</pre>

<p>If you get errors trying to build, it means you have another version of Autoconf installed and used as default. To use Autoconf 2.13, run:</p>

<pre><code>​brew link --overwrite autoconf@2.13</code></pre>

<h4 id="2.1b_Install_Dependencies_via_MacPorts">2.1b Install Dependencies via MacPorts</h4>

<p>MacPorts is a package manager for macOS. If you are running Homebrew, you can ignore this section.</p>

<p>To install MacPorts, go to their <a class="external" href="http://www.macports.org/install.php" title="http://www.macports.org/install.php">install page</a>, download the .dmg for your platform, and install it. If you already have MacPorts installed, ensure it is up to date by running:</p>

<pre class="eval"><code>sudo port selfupdate
sudo port sync</code>
</pre>

<p>The first of these commands will ask for your root password.</p>

<p>Common errors include:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>sudo</code> doesn't accept a blank password: create a password for your account in System Preferences.</li>
 <li><code>port</code> command not found: add it to your path (see the troubleshooting section below).</li>
</ul>

<p>Use MacPorts to install the packages needed for building Firefox:</p>

<pre class="eval"><code>sudo port install libidl autoconf213 yasm</code>
</pre>

<p>You'll then see lots of output as MacPorts builds and installs these packages and their dependencies -- it takes a while, so go grab a cup of coffee.</p>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> By default, this will install Python 2.7, which in turn will pull in all of the X11 libraries, which may take a while to build.  You don't need any of those to build Firefox; you may want to consider adding <span style="font-family: courier new;">+no_tkinter</span> to the install line to build a python without support for the X11 UI packages.  This should result in a much faster install.</div>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> With older versions of Xcode (eg 6.4) you may need to use MacPorts to get the proper version of clang, such as clang-3.6 or later. See bugs in Core, Build Config referring to clang.</div>

<h3 id="2.2_Install_Mercurial">2.2 Install Mercurial</h3>

<p>Mozilla's source code is hosted in Mercurial repositories. You use Mercurial to interact with these repositories. There are many ways to install Mercurial on macOS:</p>

<ol>
 <li>Install <a class="external" href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">official builds from Selenic</a></li>
 <li>Install via MacPorts:
  <pre><code>sudo port install mercurial</code></pre>

  <ul>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Install via Homebrew:
  <pre><code>brew install mercurial</code></pre>

  <ul>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Install via Pip:
  <pre><code>easy_install pip &amp;&amp; pip install mercurial</code></pre>

  <ul>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have installed Mercurial, test it by running:</p>

<pre><code>hg version</code>
</pre>

<p>If this works, congratulations! You'll want to configure your Mercurial settings to match other developers. See <a href="/en-US/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial" title="Getting Mozilla Source Code Using Mercurial">Getting Mozilla Source Code Using Mercurial</a>.</p>

<p>If this fails with the error "<code>ValueError: unknown locale: UTF-8</code>", then see the <a class="external" href="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/UnixInstall#head-1c10f216d5b9ccdcb2613ea37d407eb45f22a394" title="http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/index.cgi/UnixInstall#head-1c10f216d5b9ccdcb2613ea37d407eb45f22a394">workarounds</a> on the Mercurial wiki's Unix Install page.</p>

<p>When trying to clone a repository you may get an HTTP 500 error (internal server error). This seems to be due to something that Mac Mercurial sends to the server (it's been observed both with MacPort and selenic.com Mercurial binaries). Try restarting your shell, your computer, or reinstall Mercurial (in that order), then report back here what worked, please.</p>

<h3 id="3._Obtain_a_copy_of_the_Mozilla_source_code">3. Obtain a copy of the Mozilla source code</h3>

<p>You may want to read <a href="/en-US/Developer_Guide/Source_Code/Mercurial" title="Getting Mozilla Source Code Using Mercurial">Getting Mozilla Source Code Using Mercurial</a> for the complete instructions. If you are interested in Firefox development:</p>

<p># The following will create a new directory, Mozilla-central, in the<br>
 # current one with the contents of the remote repository. This command<br>
 # will take many minutes to run, as it will be copying a couple hundred<br>
 # megabytes of data over the internet.</p>

<p>$ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/<br>
 $ cd Mozilla-central</p>

<p id=".C2.A04._Configure_source_tree_for_build_options"><span id="1240509853482S" style="display: none;"> </span>(If you are building Firefox for Android, you should now return to the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android#Mac_OS_X" title="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Mobile/Fennec/Android#Mac_OS_X">Android build instructions</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="4._Configure_the_Mozilla_source_tree_for_build_options">4. Configure the Mozilla source tree for build options</h3>

<p>In your checked out source tree, you'll create a new file, <code>.mozconfig</code>, which contains your build options. For more on this file, see <a href="/en/Configuring_Build_Options" title="Configuring Build Options">Configuring Build Options</a>.</p>

<p>To quickly get started, create the file <code>.mozconfig</code> file in your source tree clone with the following contents:</p>

<pre class="eval"># Define where build files should go. This places them in the directory
# "obj-ff-dbg" under the current source directory
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/obj-ff-dbg

# Enable debug builds
ac_add_options --enable-debug
</pre>

<p>Builds require the 10.9 SDK or higher. If you'd like to ensure compatibility with an operating system version previous to the one you are building on, you can explicitly specify an SDK by adding a line like this:</p>

<pre class="eval">ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk
</pre>

<p>Or, check the /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms directory to see which SDKs are installed, and pick one to add into your .mozconfig.</p>

<p>Firefox no longer builds with gcc 4.8 or earlier, but the build system should automatically select clang if it is available in the PATH. If that is not the case, you need to set CC and CXX. For instance, if you installed Clang 3.7 via Homebrew, then you need to have</p>

<pre class="eval">CC=clang-mp-3.7
CXX=clang++-mp-3.7</pre>

<p>If you installed Autoconf 2.13 with the Homebrew recipe linked above, you may need to add the following to your <code>.mozconfig</code>:</p>

<pre class="eval">mk_add_options AUTOCONF=/usr/local/Cellar/autoconf@2.13/2.13/bin/autoconf213</pre>

<h3 id="5._Build">5. Build</h3>

<p>Once you have your <code>.mozconfig</code> file in place, you should be able to build!</p>

<pre><code>./mach build</code></pre>

<p>If the build step works, you should be able to find the built application inside <code>obj-ff-dbg/dist/</code>. If building the browser with <code>--enable-debug</code>, the name of the application is <code>NightlyDebug.app</code>. To launch the application, try running the following:</p>

<pre><code>./mach run</code></pre>

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The compiled application may also be named after the branch you're building; for example, if you changed these instructions to fetch the <code>mozilla-1.9.2</code> branch, the application will be named <code>Namoroka.app</code> or <code>NamorokaDebug.app</code>.</div>

<h2 id="Hardware_Requirements" name="Hardware_Requirements">Hardware requirements</h2>

<p>There are no specific hardware requirements, provided that the hardware accommodates all of the <a href="#Software_Requirements">software</a> required to build Firefox. Firefox can take a long time to build, so more CPU, more RAM and lots of fast disks are always recommended.</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel CPUs are required. Building for PowerPC chips is not supported.</li>
 <li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2GB RAM minimum, 8GB recommended.</li>
 <li><strong>Disk Space:</strong> At least 30GB of free disk space.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Software_Requirements" name="Software_Requirements">Software requirements</h2>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Operating System:</strong> Mac OS X 10.9 or later. It is advisable to upgrade to the latest “point” release by running Software Update, found in the Apple menu. You will need administrative privileges to set up your development environment</li>
 <li><strong>Development Environment:</strong> Xcode. You can obtain from the App Store.</li>
 <li><strong>Package Management:</strong> Either <em><a class="external" href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a></em> or Homebrew.</li>
</ul>

<p>These options are specific to Mozilla builds for macOS. For a more general overview of build options and the <code>.mozconfig</code> file, see <a href="/en/Configuring_Build_Options" title="en/Configuring_Build_Options">Configuring Build Options</a>. For specific information on configuring to build a universal binary, see <a href="/en/Mac_OS_X_Universal_Binaries" title="en/Mac_OS_X_Universal_Binaries">Mac OS X Universal Binaries</a>.</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Compiler:</strong> Firefox releases are no longer built with gcc-4.8 or earlier. A recent copy of clang is needed.

  <ul>
   <li>There are some options on where to get clang:
    <ul>
     <li>Newer versions of Xcode. The one in Xcode 7.0 or newer and the open source 3.6 release should work.<br>
      (Xcode 6.4 is based on pre-release of clang 3.6, that doesn't match to requirement.)</li>
     <li>Following the instructions in the <a class="external" href="http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html">clang website</a> for information on how to get it.</li>
     <li>Using some of the package managers (see above).</li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>Once clang is installed, make sure it is on the PATH and configure should use it.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>The following options, specified with <code>ac_add_options</code>, are lines that are intended to be added to your <code>.mozconfig</code> file.</p>

<ul>
 <li>macOS<strong> SDK:</strong> This selects the version of the system headers and libraries to build against, ensuring that the product you build will be able to run on older systems with less complete APIs available. Selecting an SDK with this option overrides the default headers and libraries in <code>/usr/include</code>, <code>/usr/lib</code>, and <code>/System/Library</code>. Mac macOS SDKs are installed in <code>/Developer/SDKs</code> during the <a href="#Software_Requirements">Xcode installation</a> by selecting the <strong>Cross Development</strong> category in the installer’s <strong>Customize</strong> screen.

  <pre>ac_add_options --with-macos-sdk=/path/to/SDK
</pre>

  <p>Official trunk builds use <code>/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk</code>. Check <a href="https://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/build/macosx/cross-mozconfig.common#23"><code>build/macosx/universal/mozconfig.common</code></a> for the SDK version used for official builds of any particular source release.</p>

  <p>Applications built against a particular SDK will usually run on earlier versions of Mac macOS as long as they are careful not to use features or frameworks only available on later versions. Note that some frameworks (notably AppKit) behave differently at runtime depending on which SDK was used at build time. This may be the source of bugs that only appear on certain platforms or in certain builds.</p>
 </li>
</ul>

<p>For macOS builds, defines are set up as follows:</p>

<ul>
 <li><code>XP_MACOSX</code> is defined</li>
 <li><code>XP_UNIX</code> is defined</li>
 <li><code>XP_MAC</code> is <strong>not</strong> defined. <code>XP_MAC</code> is obsolete and has been removed from the source tree (see {{ Bug(281889) }}). It was used for CFM (non-Mach-O) builds for the classic (pre-X) Mac OS.</li>
</ul>

<p>This requires care when writing code for Unix platforms that exclude Mac:</p>

<pre>#if defined(XP_UNIX) &amp;&amp; !defined(XP_MACOSX)
</pre>

<h2 id="Troubleshooting" name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Unable to build with GCC:</strong> Apple used to ship a GCC based on vanilla GCC 4.2. They still ship LLVM-GCC (which is also base on GCC 4.2). Mozilla does <em>not</em> support building with any GCC 4.2 variant anymore. On macOS, non-Apple (i.e. stock) GCCs are also not supported (they don't support blocks), so you must use clang on macOS.</li>
 <li><strong>Using Fink with Virex 7.2:</strong> There is a conflict between Fink and Virex 7.2. Both place files within <code>/sw</code>. If you have Virex installed, you will need to upgrade to at least version 7.2.1, as described in the <a class="external" href="http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/index.php#2003-04-16%20Virex%20problem%20resolved">Fink News (2003-04-16)</a>.</li>
 <li><strong>If configure (or generally building with clang) fails with <code>fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found</code>:</strong> Make sure the Xcode command line tools are installed by running. <code>xcode-select --install</code>. [jgilbert] found this necessary during an install for 10.9.</li>
 <li><strong>For inexplicable errors in the configure phase:</strong> Review all modifications of your PATH in .bash_profile, .bash_rc or whatever configuration file you're using for your chosen shell. Removing all modifications and then re-adding them one-by-one can narrow down problems.</li>
