<p>They aren’t complicated, but there are a few prerequisites to building Firefox on Linux. You need:</p>

<ul>
 <li>A 64-bit installation of Linux. You can check by opening a terminal window; if <code>uname -m</code> returns <code>x86_64</code> you can proceed.</li>
 <li>Next, you’ll need Python 2.7 and Python 3.x installed. You can check with <code>python --version</code> to see if you have it already. If not, you can install it with your distribution’s package manager. Make sure your system is up to date!</li>
 <li>Finally, a reasonably fast internet connection and 30GB of free disk space.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="heading-tertiary" id="Getting_Started.">Getting Started.</h3>

<p>Getting set up on Linux is fast and easy.</p>

<p>If you don’t have one yet, create a "<code>src</code>" directory for yourself under your home directory:</p>

<pre><code>mkdir src &amp;&amp; cd src</code></pre>

<p>Next <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py">download the bootstrap.py script</a> and save it in the <code>src/</code> directory created above.</p>

<div class="warning">
<p>Building Firefox in Linux on top of a non-native file system - for example, on a mounted NTFS partition - is explicitly not supported. While a build environment like this may succeed it may also fail while claiming to have succeeded, which can be quite difficult to diagnose and fix.</p>
</div>

<p>And finally, in your terminal from above start the bootstrapper like this:</p>

<pre><code>python bootstrap.py</code></pre>

<p>... and follow the prompts. This will use mercurial to checkout the source code. If you prefer to work with git, use this command instead:</p>

<pre><code>python bootstrap.py --vcs=git</code></pre>

<p><a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> is Mozilla’s issue tracker; you'll need to be able to log into it to comment on a bug or submit a patch.  You can either use your <a href="https://github.com">GitHub account</a>, or you can <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi">sign up for a Bugzilla account here.</a></p>

<p>As well as Bugzilla, much of Mozilla’s internal communication happens over IRC. You can download <a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">Limechat here for mac</a>, <a href="https://hexchat.github.io/index.html">HexChat here for Windows and Linux</a> and learn how to <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC">connect to Mozilla with IRC here</a>.

<h3 class="heading-tertiary" id="Get_The_Code">Get The Code</h3>

<p>If you haven't let <code>bootstrap.py</code> download <code>mozilla-unified</code>, you can clone <code>mozilla-central</code> repository with the following command, in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central</code></pre>

<p>this could take some time depending on your network connection and environment.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>If you have any network connection issues and cannot clone with the above command, try <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Source_Code/Mercurial/Bundles">Mercurial Bundle</a>.</p>

<p>You’re ready; now we can tie it all together. In your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>cd mozilla-central</code></pre>

<p>If you are not working on the C/C++ files you can also opt for <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Artifact_builds">Artifact Builds</a> which are much faster. To enable artifact build set up a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">.mozconfig</a> file with the following options:</p>

<pre><code># Automatically download and use compiled C++ components:
# This option will disable C/C++ compilation
ac_add_options --enable-artifact-builds

# Write build artifacts to (not mandatory):
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=./objdir-frontend</code></pre>

<p>If you plan to walk through code with a debugger, set up a <a href="/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/Build_Instructions/Configuring_Build_Options">.mozconfig</a> file with the following options:</p>

<pre>ac_add_options --disable-optimize
ac_add_options --enable-debug
</pre>

<p>is could take some time depending on your network connection and environment.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>Older clang versions (especially clang 6) <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1594686">from LTS linux distributions sometimes miscompile Firefox</a>, resulting in startup crashes when starting the resulting build. If this happens, you can force the use of the <code>clang</code> version that <code>./mach bootstrap</code> downloaded by adding the following to your <code>.mozconfig</code>:</p>

<pre>export CC=path/to/home/.mozbuild/clang/bin/clang
export CXX=path/to/home/.mozbuild/clang/bin/clang++</pre>
</div>

<p>And finally, run the build command:</p>

<pre><code>./mach build</code></pre>

<p>If you encounter any error related to LLVM/Clang on Ubuntu or Debian, download the latest version of LLVM and Clang and then re-run <code>./mach build</code>.</p>

<p>And you’re on your way, building your own copy of Firefox from source. Don’t be discouraged if this takes a while; this takes some time on even the fastest modern machines, and as much as two hours or more on older hardware. When the <code>--enable-artifact-builds</code> option is used, builds usually finish within a few minutes.</p>

<p>There’s one more thing you can do for yourself while you’re waiting: create an account for yourself on <a href="https://mozillians.org/">Mozillians</a>. Mozillians is the Mozilla community directory, where you can connect with people who share your interests, projects or countries. This step is optional, but we think it will be worth your while.</p>

<h2 id="Detailed_Requirements">Detailed Requirements</h2>

<h3 id="General_considerations">General considerations</h3>

<ul>
 <li>2GB RAM with an additional 2GB of available swap space is the bare minimum, and more RAM is always better - having 8GB or more will dramatically improve build time.</li>
 <li>30 GB free disk space.</li>
 <li>A 64-bit x86 CPU and a 64-bit OS. As of early 2015 it is no longer possible to do a full build of Firefox from source on most 32-bit systems; a 64-bit OS is required. "<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Artifact_builds">Artifact builds</a>" may be possible, but are not a supported configuration. On Linux you can determine this by typing "<code>uname -a</code>" in a terminal.</li>
 <li>A recent version of Clang is required to build Firefox. You can <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_CXX_in_Mozilla_code">learn more about the features we use and their compiler support here</a></li>
 <li>autoconf 2.13. Most Linux distros now install a later version of autoconf, which the build system cannot use, reporting the error "<code>*** Couldn't find autoconf 2.13.  Stop.</code>" However a separate <code>autoconf2.13</code> package is usually available. To install autoconf 2.13 in Debian based distros copy this line and paste it into a terminal window:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>sudo apt install autoconf2.13</code></pre>

<ul>
 <li>If you are on a Fedora machine then simply install the following prerequisites from the terminal window:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>sudo dnf install @development-tools @c-development autoconf213 gtk2-devel gtk3-devel libXt-devel GConf2-devel dbus-glib-devel yasm-devel alsa-lib-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel </code></pre>

<h3 id="Requirements_for_Debian_Ubuntu_users">Requirements for Debian / Ubuntu users</h3>

<p>You need a number of different packages:</p>

<pre># the rust compiler
aptitude install rustc

# the rust package manager
aptitude install cargo

# the required (old) version of autoconf
aptitude install autoconf2.13

# the headers of important libs
aptitude install libgtk-2-dev
aptitude install libgtk-3-dev
aptitude install libgconf2-dev
aptitude install libdbus-glib-1-dev
aptitude install libpulse-dev

# rust dependencies
cargo install cbindgen

# an assembler for compiling webm
aptitude install yasm </pre>

<h3 id="One-Line_Bootstrapping">One-Line Bootstrapping</h3>

<p>Our system bootstrapping script can automatically install the required dependencies. You can download and run it by copying this line and pasting it into a terminal window:</p>

<pre><code><span class="difflineplus">wget -q https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py -O bootstrap.py &amp;&amp; python bootstrap.py</span></code></pre>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: piping bootstrap.py to stdin of a python process will cause interactive prompts in the bootstrap script to fail, causing the bootstrap process to fail. You must run Python against a local file.</p>
</div>

<p>If the above command fails, the reason is often because some Linux distributions ship with an outdated list of root certificates. In this case, you should upgrade your Linux distribution or use your browser to download the file. That ensures that you will get it from the right source.</p>

<p>If you get an error from this process, consider <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">filing a bug</a> saying that the bootstrapper didn't work and <a href="mailto:mhoye@mozilla.com">contact Mike Hoye</a> directly for help. Please include the error message and some details about your operating system.</p>

<p>If you have already checked out the source code via Mercurial or Git you can also use <a href="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach" title="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach">mach</a> with the bootstrap command:</p>

<pre><code>./mach bootstrap</code></pre>

<h4 id="Common_Bootstrapper_Failures">Common Bootstrapper Failures</h4>

<pre class="bz_comment_text" id="comment_text_0"><code>wget: command not found</code></pre>

<p>You may not have wget (or curl) installed. In that case, you can either install it via your package manager: </p>

<p>On Debian-based distros like Ubuntu:</p>

<pre class="syntaxbox"><code>sudo apt install wget </code></pre>

<p>On Fedora-based distros:</p>

<pre class="syntaxbox"><code>sudo dnf install wget</code></pre>

<p>or you can just <a href="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py" title="https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py">download bootstrap.py</a> using your browser and then run it with this command:</p>

<pre><code><span class="difflineplus">python bootstrap.py </span></code></pre>

<p>In some cases people who've customized their command prompt to include emoji or other non-text symbols have found that bootstrap.py fails with a <code>UnicodeDecodeError</code>. We have a bug filed for that but in the meantime if you run into this problem you'll need to change your prompt back to something boring.</p>
