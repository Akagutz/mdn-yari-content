</ul>

<p>For both Desktop and Mobile development, please bear the following in mind:</p>

<ul>
 <li>While you can build Firefox on older hardware it can take quite a bit of time to compile on slower machines. Having at least 8GB of RAM is recommended, and more is always better. The build process is both CPU and I/O intensive, so building on a machine with an SSD is also strongly preferred.</li>
 <li>Fast broadband internet is strongly recommended as well. Both the development environment and the source code repository are quite large.</li>
 <li>Though you can build Firefox to run on 32-bit machines, the build process for almost all of our products requires a 64-bit OS.</li>
</ul>
