<p>The current official git mirror of the Firefox code base (also known as "gecko" or "mozilla-central") can be found at <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev">https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev</a>.  This repository contains all of the branches that are part of mainline development, including the train branches mozilla-central (nightly), mozilla-aurora (developer edition), mozilla-beta, and mozilla-release.</p>

<p>If you are looking to work with other Mozilla branches, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-projects">https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-projects</a> might also be of use. This repository contains the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/ReleaseEngineering/DisposableProjectBranches#BOOKING_SCHEDULE">project branches</a> (also known as "twigs") whose use varied.</p>

<p>If you would prefer to use git directly with the hg repositories this <a href="https://github.com/glandium/git-cinnabar/wiki/Mozilla:-A-git-workflow-for-Gecko-development" id="workflow" name="workflow">workflow</a> describes how to proceed. Using this approach will also let you push directly from your git repository to mercurial.</p>

<p>The <a href="#workflow">workflow</a> mentioned above is the most current and <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/GitHub/Gecko_Repositories">officially documented</a> approach to using git to interact with mozilla-central.</p>
