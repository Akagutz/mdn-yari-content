<p>When tracking down the causes of process hangs, it is often helpful to obtain a process dump while the process is experiencing a hang. This article describes how to get a process dump with Task Manager on Windows. (To get a process dump for Thunderbird or some other product, substitute the product name where ever you see Firefox in these instructions.)</p>

<h2 id="Caution">Caution</h2>

<p>The memory dump that will be created through this process is a complete snapshot of the state of Firefox when you create the file, so it contains URLs of active tabs, history information, and possibly even passwords depending on what you are doing when the snapshot is taken. It is advisable to create a new, blank profile to use when reproducing the hang and capturing the memory dump. Please ask for help doing this!</p>
