<p>There are three tiers of <strong>supported Firefox build targets</strong> at this time. These tiers represent the shared engineering priorities of the Mozilla project.</p>

<p>The term <strong>"Tier-1 platform" </strong>refers to those platforms - CPU architectures and operating systems - that are the primary focus of Firefox development efforts. Tier-1 platforms are fully supported by Mozilla's <a href="/en-US/docs/">continuous integration processes</a> and the <a href="/en-US/docs/">Try Server</a>. Any proposed change to Firefox on these platforms that results in build failures, test failures, performance regressions or other major problems <strong>will be reverted immediately</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Tier-1 Firefox platforms</strong> and their supported compilers are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Android on Linux x86, x86-64, ARMv7 and ARMv8-A (clang)</li>
 <li>Linux/x86 and x86-64 (gcc and clang)</li>
 <li>OSX 10.9 and later on x86-64 (clang)</li>
 <li>Windows/x86, x86-64 and AArch64 (clang-cl)</li>
</ul>

<p>Prior to Firefox 63, Windows/x86 and Windows/x86-64 relied on the MSVC compiler; from <strong>Firefox 63 onward MSVC is not supported</strong>. Older 32-bit x86 CPUs without SSE2 instructions such as the Pentium III and Athlon XP are also <strong>not considered Tier-1 platforms, and are not supported</strong>. Note also that while Windows/x86 and ARM/AArch64 are supported <em>as build targets</em>, it is not possible to build Firefox <em>on </em>Windows/x86 or Windows/AArch64 systems.</p>

<p><strong>Tier-2 platforms </strong>are actively maintained by the Mozilla community, though with less rigorous requirements. Proposed changes resulting in breakage or regressions limited to these platforms <strong>may not immediately result in reversion</strong>. However, developers who break these platforms are expected to work with platform maintainers to fix problems, and <strong>may be required to revert their changes</strong> if a fix cannot be found.</p>

<p>The <strong>Tier-2 Firefox platforms</strong> and their supported compilers are:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Linux/AArch64 (clang)</li>
 <li>Windows/x86 (mingw-clang) - maintained by Tom Ritter and Jacek Caban -
  <ul>
   <li><em>Note that some features of this platform are disabled, as they require MS COM or the w32api project doesn't expose the necessary Windows APIs.</em></li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tier-3 platforms</strong> have a maintainer or community which attempt to keep the platform working. These platforms are <strong>not supported by our continuous integration processes</strong>, and <strong>Mozilla does not routinely test on these platforms</strong>, nor do we block further development on the outcomes of those tests.</p>

<p>At any given time a Firefox built from mozilla-central for these platforms may or may not work correctly or build at all.</p>

<p><strong>Tier-3 Firefox platforms</strong> include:Â </p>

<ul>
 <li>Linux on various CPU architectures including ARM variants not listed above, PowerPC, and x86 CPUs without SSE2 support - maintained by various Linux distributions</li>
 <li>FreeBSD/x86, x86-64, Aarch64 (clang) - maintained by Jan Beich</li>
 <li>OpenBSD/x86, x86-64 (clang) - maintained by Landry Breuil</li>
 <li>NetBSD/x86-64 (gcc) - maintained by David Laight</li>
 <li>Solaris/x86-64, sparc64 (gcc) - maintained by Petr Sumbera</li>
 <li><s>Windows/x86-64 (mingw-gcc)</s> - Unsupported due to requirements for clang-bindgen</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're filing a bug against Firefox on a Tier-3 platform (or any combination of OS, CPU and compiler not listed above) please bear in mind that Mozilla developers do not reliably have access to non-Tier-1 platforms or build environments. To be actionable bug reports against non-Tier-1 platforms should include as much information as possible to help the owner of the bug determine the cause of the problem and the proper solution. If you can provide a patch, a regression range or assist in verifying that the developer's patches work for your platform, that would help a lot towards getting your bugs fixed and checked into the tree.</p>
