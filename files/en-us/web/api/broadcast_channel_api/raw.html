<p>{{DefaultAPISidebar("Broadcast Channel API")}}</p>

<p>The <strong>Broadcast Channel API</strong> allows simple communication between {{glossary("browsing context", "browsing contexts")}} (that is <em>windows</em>, <em>tabs</em>, <em>frames</em>, or <em>iframes</em>) with the same {{glossary("origin")}} (usually pages from the same site).</p>

<p>{{AvailableInWorkers}}</p>

<p>Broadcast channels are named and bound to a specific origin.</p>

<p>By creating a {{domxref("BroadcastChannel")}} object, which is listening to the underlying channel, you are able to receive any message that has been posted to it. An interesting point is that you no longer have to maintain a reference to iframes or workers that you wish to communicate with. They can simply “subscribe” to particular channels by constructing a {{domxref("BroadcastChannel")}}, and have full-duplex (bi-directional) communication between all of them.</p>

<h3 id="Creating_or_joining_a_channel">Creating or joining a channel</h3>

<p>The <code>BroadcastChannel</code> interface is very simple. A client joins a specific broadcast channel by creating a {{domxref("BroadcastChannel")}} object. The <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/BroadcastChannel.BroadcastChannel">constructor</a> takes one single parameter, the <em>name</em> of the channel, used to identify it. If it is the first to connect to a broadcast channel, the underlying resource is created.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Connection to a broadcast channel
var bc = new BroadcastChannel('test_channel');
</pre>

<h3 id="Sending_a_message">Sending a message</h3>

<p>Posting a message is now trivial. It is enough to call the {{domxref("BroadcastChannel.postMessage", "postMessage()")}} method on the <code>BroadcastChannel</code> object. This method takes any object as an argument. A very simple example would be a {{domxref("DOMString")}} text message:</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Example of sending of a very simple message
bc.postMessage('This is a test message.');
</pre>

<p>Any kind of object can be sent, not just a {{domxref("DOMString")}}. The API doesn't associate any semantics to the messages, so it is up to the participant to the channel to know what kind of messages to expect and what to do with them.</p>

<h3 id="Receiving_a_message">Receiving a message</h3>

<p>When a message is posted, a {{event("message")}} event will be dispatched to each {{domxref("BroadcastChannel")}} object connected to this channel. There is no action by default, but a new function can be implemented using the {{domxref("BroadcastChannel.onmessage", "onmessage")}} event handler.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Example of a simple event handler that only
// logs the event to the console
bc.onmessage = function (ev) { console.log(ev); }
</pre>

<h3 id="Disconnecting_a_channel">Disconnecting a channel</h3>

<p>To leave a channel, it is required to call the {{domxref("BroadcastChannel.close", "close()")}} method on the object. This disconnects the link between the object and the underlying channel and allows garbage collection to happen.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">// Disconnect the channel
bc.close()
</pre>

<h2 id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Broadcast Channel API is a very simple API and the self-contained interface allows cross-context communication. It can be used to detect user actions in other tabs within a same site origin environment, like when the user logs into an account. The messaging protocol is not defined and the different documents in the different contexts need to implement it themselves: there is no negotiation, nor requirement from the specification.</p>
