<p><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>register()</code></strong> method of the {{domxref("ServiceWorkerContainer")}} interface creates or updates a {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} for the given <code>scriptURL</code>.</span></p>

<p>If successful, a service worker registration ties the provided script URL to a <em>scope</em>, which is subsequently used for navigation matching. You can call this method unconditionally from the controlled page. I.e., you don't need to first check whether there's an active registration.</p>

<p>There is frequent confusion surrounding the meaning and use of <em>scope</em>. Since a service worker can't have a scope broader than its own location, only use the <code>scope</code> option when you need a scope that is narrower than the default.</p>

<h2 id="Syntax">Syntax</h2>

<pre class="syntaxbox">ServiceWorkerContainer.register(scriptURL, options)
  .then(function(ServiceWorkerRegistration) { ... });</pre>

<h3 id="Parameters">Parameters</h3>

<dl>
	<dt><code>scriptURL</code></dt>
	<dd>The URL of the service worker script. The registered service worker file needs to have a valid <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types#JavaScript_types">JavaScript MIME type</a>.</dd>
	<dt><code>options</code> {{optional_inline}}</dt>
	<dd>An object containing registration options. Currently available options are:
	<ul>
		<li><code>scope</code>: A {{domxref("USVString")}} representing a URL that defines a service worker's registration scope; that is, what range of URLs a service worker can control. This is usually a relative URL. It is relative to the base URL of the application. By default, the <code>scope</code> value for a service worker registration is set to the directory where the service worker script is located. See the <a href="#Examples">Examples</a> section for more information on how it works.</li>
	</ul>
	</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="Return_value">Return value</h3>

<p>A {{domxref("Promise")}} that resolves with a {{domxref("ServiceWorkerRegistration")}} object.</p>

<h2 id="Examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The examples described here should be taken together to get a better understanding of how service workers scope applies to a page.</p>

<p>The following example uses the default value of <code>scope</code> (by omitting it). The service worker in this case will control <code>example.com/index.html</code> as well as pages underneath it, like <code>example.com/product/description.html</code>.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Register a service worker hosted at the root of the
  // site using the default scope.
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js').then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Service worker registration succeeded:', registration);
  }, /*catch*/ function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Service workers are not supported.');
}</pre>

<p>The following code, if included in a page at the root of a site, would apply to exactly the same pages as the example above. Remember the scope, when included, uses the page's location as its base. Alternatively, if this code were included in a page at <code>example.com/product/description.html</code>, the scope of <code>'./'</code> would mean that the service worker only applies to resources under <code>example.com/product</code>. If I needed to register a service worker on <code>example.com/product/description.html</code> that applied to all of <code>example.com</code>, I would leave off the scope as above.</p>

<pre class="brush: js">if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
  // Register a service worker hosted at the root of the
  // site using a more restrictive scope.
  navigator.serviceWorker.register('/sw.js', {scope: './'}).then(function(registration) {
    console.log('Service worker registration succeeded:', registration);
  }, /*catch*/ function(error) {
    console.log('Service worker registration failed:', error);
  });
} else {
  console.log('Service workers are not supported.');
}
</pre>
