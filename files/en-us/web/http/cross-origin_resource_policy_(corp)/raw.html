<p class="summary"><strong>Cross-Origin Resource Policy</strong> is an opt-in mechanism that allows web applications to protect against certain cross-origin requests, such as those issued by the browser when resources are embedded using elements such as <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>. This serves as an additional layer of protection above and beyond the {{Glossary("same-origin policy")}} which can mitigate speculative side channel attacks as well as Cross-Site Script Inclusion attacks. Cross-Origin Resource Policy complements <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb">Cross-Origin Read Blocking</a> (CORB), which is a mechanism to prevent some cross-origin reads by default.</p>

<p>The policy is only effective for <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-request-mode"><samp>no-cors</samp></a> requests, which are issued by default for CORS-safelisted methods/headers.</p>

<p>As this policy is expressed via a <em>response header</em>, the actual request is not preventedâ€”rather, the browser prevents the <em>result</em> from being leaked by stripping the response body.</p>

<h2 id="History">History</h2>

<p>In early 2018, two side-channel hardware vulnerabilities known as <em>Meltdown</em> and <em>Spectre</em> were disclosed. These vulnerabilities allowed sensitive data disclosure due to a race condition which arose as part of speculative execution functionality, designed to improve performance.</p>

<p>Against this backdrop, Chromium shipped a feature known as <a href="https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#corb">Cross-Origin Read Blocking</a>. This mechanism automatically protects a limited set of cross-origin resources (of <samp>Content-Type</samp> HTML, JSON and XML) against cross-origin reads. If the application does not serve a <samp>no-sniff</samp> directive, Chromium will attempt to guess the <samp>Content-Type</samp> using a set of heuristics and apply the protection anyway.</p>

<p>Cross-Origin Resource Policy, in contrast, is an opt-in response header mechanism available to web developers which can protect <em>any</em> resource. There is no need for the browser to perform MIME type sniffing. The concept was originally proposed in 2012 (as <samp>From-Origin</samp>) but <a href="https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/687">resurrected</a> in Q2 of 2018 and implemented in Safari and Chromium.</p>

<h2 id="Usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Web applications set a Cross-Origin Resource Policy via the {{HTTPHeader("Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy")}} HTTP response header.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The concept of a "site" is defined in the <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#host-same-site">URL standard</a> and involves checking the <em>registrable domain</em>. This is a weaker concept than an {{Glossary("origin")}} and provides less protection.</p>
</div>

<p>The header accepts one of two values:</p>

<dl>
 <dt>same-site</dt>
 <dd>Only requests that the browser recognizes as from the same <em>{{Glossary("Site")}}</em> (i.e. registrable domain) will be allowed to read the resource.</dd>
 <dt>same-origin</dt>
 <dd>Only requests that the browser recognizes as from the same <em>{{Glossary("origin")}}</em> (i.e. [scheme, host, port] combination) will be allowed to read the resource.</dd>
</dl>

<pre>Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-site | same-origin</pre>

<p>During a cross-origin resource policy check, if the header is set, the browser will deny no-cors requests issued from a different origin/site.</p>
