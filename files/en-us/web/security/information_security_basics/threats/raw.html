<p>This article discusses threats, explaining what they are and how they can affect network traffic.</p>
</div>

<p>A<em> threat</em> is any circumstance or event with the potential to adversely impact data or systems via unauthorized access, destruction, disclosure, or modification of information, and/or denial of service. Threats may involve intentional actors (e.g., attacker who wants to access information on a server) or unintentional actors (e.g., administrator who forgets to disable user accounts of a former employee.)  Threats can be local, such as a disgruntled employee, or remote, such as an attacker in another geographical area.</p>

<p>A<em> threat source</em> is the cause of a threat, such as a hostile cyber or physical attack, a human error of omission or commission, a failure of organization-controlled hardware or software, or other failure beyond the control of the organization. A<em> threat event</em> is an event or situation initiated or caused by a threat source that has the potential for causing adverse impact.</p>

<p>Many threats against data and resources are possible because of mistakes—either bugs in operating system and applications that create exploitable vulnerabilities, or errors made by end users and administrators.  </p>

<p>Network traffic typically passes through intermediate computers, such as routers, or is carried over unsecured networks, such as wireless hotspots. Because of this, it can be intercepted by a third party. Threats against network traffic include the following:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Eavesdropping.</strong> Information remains intact, but its privacy is compromised. For example, someone could learn your credit card number, record a sensitive conversation, or intercept classified information.</li>
 <li><strong>Tampering.</strong> Information in transit is changed or replaced and then sent on to the recipient. For example, someone could alter an order for goods or change a person's resume.</li>
 <li><strong>Impersonation.</strong> Information passes to a person who poses as the intended recipient. Impersonation can take two forms:
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Spoofing.</strong> A person can pretend to be someone else. For example, a person can pretend to have the email address <code><a class="link-mailto" href="mailto:jdoe@example.net" rel="freelink">jdoe@example.net</a></code>, or a computer can identify itself as a site called <code>www.example.net</code> when it is not. This type of impersonation is known as spoofing.</li>
   <li><strong>Misrepresentation.</strong> A person or organization can misrepresent itself. For example, suppose the site <code>www.example.net</code> pretends to be a furniture store when it is really just a site that takes credit-card payments but never sends any goods.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
