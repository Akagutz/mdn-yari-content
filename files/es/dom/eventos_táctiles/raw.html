<p>Experimental support for touch events is added in {{ Gecko("2.0") }}. These allow you to track the movement of the user's finger on a touch screen, monitoring the raw touch events generated by the system. Although touch events are based on — and work similarly to — mouse events, each event includes an identifier that allows you to track multiple fingers moving on the screen at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="Event_fields">Event fields</h2>
<p>Touch events are based upon mouse events, and thereby share all mouse event fields. They include one additional field.</p>
<dl>
 <dt>
  streamId</dt>
 <dd>
  A unique integer identifying the finger generating the event. When the <code>MozTouchDown</code> event is built, a unique value is assigned to that finger. Corresponding <code>MozTouchMove</code> and <code>MozTouchUp</code> events for that finger will have the same streamId value. This lets you track each finger's movements on the touch screen independently. The stream ID is unique until the <code>MozTouchUp</code> event occurs; after that, the value may be recycled for another series of events.</dd>
