Websites that handle user data should use HTTPS to protect their users from hackers. Without it, it is trivial to steal user information (such as their login credentials).

Network eavesdroppers steal a user's credentials directly by sniffing the network, or modify the served page in transit to enable a plethora of attacks.</span></div>

<div id="magicdomid21"><span class="author-g-nz122z8n36s7o58x0fxu">Sometimes websites require username and passwords, but don't actually store data that is very sensitive. For example, a news site may save which news articles a user wants to go back and read, but not save any other data about a user. Web developers of the news site may be less motivated to secure their site and their user credentials. Unfortunately, password reuse is a big problem [link?]. Users use the same password across multiple sites (news websites, social networks, email providers, banks). Hence, even if access to the username and password to your site doesn't seem like a huge risk to you, it is a great risk to users who have used the same username and password to login to their bank accounts. Attackers are getting smarter; they steal username/password pairs from one site, and then try reusing them on more lucrative sites.</span></div>
