<p class="summary">Learn everything required to master CSS from scratch. We provide you with both theory and practice to help you become an awesome web developer.</p>

<p>Welcome to our introduction to {{Glossary("CSS")}}.</p>

<p>This tutorial is made to drive you in the wonderful world of CSS. If you have absolutely no idea what CSS is, we strongly encourage you to take a look at our <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics">CSS Basics</a> article. It will provide you with the minimum necessary skills to get started. This tutorial is the next step in your journey and focuses on the theory beyond CSS that is necessary to understand how things work. If you're more of a practical person, you can skip the theory and jump to <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Howto">our set of How-to articles</a> that will help you use CSS on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Okay, let's get started!</p>

<h2 id="What_is_CSS">What is CSS</h2>

<p><strong>{{Glossary("CSS")}}</strong> (<em>Cascading Style Sheets</em>) is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users. This language is formally defined by the {{Glossary("W3C")}}.</p>

<p>A <strong>document</strong> is usually a text file which is structured using a <em>markup language</em> such as {{Glossary("HTML")}}, {{Glossary("SVG")}}, or {{Glossary("XML")}}.</p>

<p><strong>Presenting</strong> a document to a user means converting it into a usable form for your audience. {{Glossary("browser","Browsers")}}, like {{Glossary("Mozilla Firefox","Firefox")}}, {{Glossary("Google Chrome","Chrome")}} or {{Glossary("Microsoft Internet Explorer","Internet Explorer")}}, are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>To be perfectly clear, a document is not necessarily the same thing as a file. The document you are reading now is not stored in a file. When your web browser requests this page, the server queries a database and generates the document, gathering parts of the document from many files. However, while learning you will essentially work with documents stored in files.</p>
</div>

<p>Web browsers apply CSS rules to a document to display them properly. A CSS rule is a set of {{Glossary("property/CSS","properties")}} associated with a {{Glossary("CSS Selector", "selector")}}. A set of CSS rules contained within a stylesheet determines how a webpage should look. "Cascading" refers to the rules that govern how selectors are prioritized to change a page's appearance. This is a very important feature, since a complex website can have thousands of CSS rules.</p>

<p>If the previous paragraph sounds like a bunch of nonsense, don't panic! The rest of this tutorial will clarify all of this.</p>

<h2 id="Using_CSS">Using CSS</h2>

<p>Okay that sounds pretty cool, let's quickly see how to link a CSS stylesheet with an HTML document. This will be the basis you'll use to fiddle with CSS in our next articles.</p>

<div class="note">
<p>In order to be able to work and test this properly you need a <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/Choose%2C_Install_and_set_up_a_text_editor">text editor</a> and a <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/Browser">web browser</a>. If you don't feel confident with setting up a working environment, feel free to use <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org">Thimble</a>, Mozilla's learning tool. If you start a project from scratch with it, it will handle all the following basic setup steps for you.</p>
</div>

<p> First of all, we need 2 files:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Create_a_basic_HTML_document">An HTML file</a> (let's say its name is <code>index.html</code>)</li>
 <li>A CSS stylesheet we'll call <code>style.css</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Create those two files in a single folder on your machine.</p>

<p><code>index.html</code> should contain the following code:</p>

<pre class="brush: html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;

  &lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet"&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  Hello World!
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>

<p><code>style.css</code> should contain the CSS rule:</p>

<pre class="brush: css">body {
  font-size: 3em;
  color: green;
}</pre>

<p>Save those two files, then open index.html within your browser and you'll see this:</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/11709/css.png" style="height: 183px; width: 440px;"></p>

<h2 id="Your_learning_journey">Your learning journey</h2>

<p>Congratulations, you've created your first CSS stylesheet, now it's time to dig deeper. At this point you have a choice to make: Would you like to get into the theory or get your hands dirty. Don't feel anxious there is no right or wrong. It's very easy and common to jump from one side to the other, it's just a matter of preference.</p>
