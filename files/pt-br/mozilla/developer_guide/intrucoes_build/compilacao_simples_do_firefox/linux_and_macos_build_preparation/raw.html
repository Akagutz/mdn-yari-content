<ul>
 <li>2GB de RAM com bastante espaço swap. RAM adicional pode diminuir significativamente o tempo de compilação.</li>
 <li>Para depuração de compilaçao: Precisa de pelo menos 8 GB de espaço livre em disco.</li>
 <li>Para compilação otimizada: Precisa de pelo menos 1 GB de espaço livre em disco (o recomendade é 6 GB).</li>
 <li>As of early 2015, it is no longer possible to compile Firefox from source on most 32-bit systems; a 64-bit OS is required. On Linux you can determine this by typing "uname -a" in a terminal.</li>
 <li>GCC 4.7 or later is required; the Firefox codebase relies on some C++ features that are not supported in GCC 4.6 or earlier.</li>
 <li>autoconf 2.13. Most Linux distros now install a later version of autoconf, which the build system cannot use, reporting the error "*** Couldn't find autoconf 2.13.  Stop." However a separate autoconf213 package is usually available.</li>
 <li>Note: Building in Linux on top of a non-native file system - for example, on a mounted NTFS partition - is explicitly not supported. While a build environment like this may succeed it may also fail while claiming to have succeeded, which can be quite difficult to diagnose and fix.</li>

<p>You can attempt running our system bootstrapping script to install all system dependencies:</p>

<pre><span class="difflineplus">wget -q https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/default/python/mozboot/bin/bootstrap.py &amp;&amp; python bootstrap.py</span></pre>

<div class="note">
<p>Note: piping bootstrap.py to stdin of a python process will cause interactive prompts in the bootstrap script to fail, causing the bootstrap process to fail. You must run Python against a local file.</p>
</div>

<p>If the above command fails, the reason is often because some Linux distributions ship with an outdated list of root certificates. In this case, you should upgrade your Linux distribution or use your browser to download the file. That ensures that you will get it from the right source.</p>

<p><span class="difflineplus">If this works, great! If not, see the appropriate section below.</span> If you encounter an error, consider <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config" title="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Core&amp;component=Build%20Config">filing a bug</a> saying that the bootstrapper didn't work. Please include output and relevant operating system details.</p>

<p>If you have already checked out the source code via Mercurial or Git you can also use <a href="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach" title="/en-US/docs/Developer_Guide/mach">mach</a> with the bootstrap command:</p>

<pre>./mach bootstrap</pre>
