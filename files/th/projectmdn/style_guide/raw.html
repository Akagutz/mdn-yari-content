  Obsolete</dt>
 <dd>
  On MDN, the term <em>obsolete</em> marks an API or technology that is not only no longer recommended, and which is no longer implemented in the browser. For Mozilla-specific technologies, the API is no longer implemented in Mozilla code; for Web standard technology, the API or feature is no longer supported by current, commonly-used browsers.</dd>
 <dt>
  Deprecated:</dt>
 <dd>
  On MDN, the term <em>deprecated</em> marks an API or technology that is no longer recommended, but is still implemented and may still work. These technologies will in theory eventually become <em>obsolete</em> and be removed, so you should stop using them. For Mozilla-specific technologies, the API is still supported in Mozilla code; for Web standard technology, the API or feature has been removed or replaced in a recent version of the defining standard.</dd>
