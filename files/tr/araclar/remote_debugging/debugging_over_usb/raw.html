<p>If you're trying to connect to a Firefox instance running on the Android OS and it doesn't show up, here are some things you can try:</p>

<ul>
 <li>Make sure you have enabled remote debugging in Firefox: open Firefox for Android, open its menu, select <code>Settings</code>, and then check the checkbox at <code>Advanced &gt; Remote debugging via USB</code>.

 </li>
 <li>Make sure that USB debugging is allowed in the device's developer settings. See <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html#Enabling">Android Debug Bridge</a> for more information about debugging on an Android device.

 </li>
 <li>If you still do not see your device in the about:debugging sidebar, try toggling <code>Remote debugging</code> on the phone.
  <ul>
   <li>Disconnect your device from your computer and turn off <code>Remote debugging</code> on the phone.</li>
   <li>Reconnect the device and turn on <code>Remote debugging</code> - this restarts the debugger instance on the phone.</li>
   <li>Try connecting again</li>
   <li>If you are using Fenix, make sure that you have opened a page in the browser.</li>
   <li>Trying changing the <code>Default USB Configuration</code> option to another mode, suchas <code>File transfer (MTP)</code>, <code>PTP</code>, or <code>Camera</code> mode.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>Check the USB cable you are using:
  <ul>
   <li>Try unplugging and replugging in the USB cable.</li>
   <li>Try plugging the USB cable into a different port on your computer. You may have to alternate between ports.</li>
   <li>Try a different USB cable. The cables that come with phones are often of poor quality and fail often.</li>
   <li>Try a shorter USB cable. Long USB cables have been known to not work so well.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>If you use Linux:
  <ul>
   <li>Make sure you added a <code>udev</code> rules file, as documented in step 3 of this guide to <a class="external external-icon" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#setting-up" rel="noopener">setting up an Android device</a>. The Android list of <a class="external external-icon" href="http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html#VendorIds" rel="noopener"><code>idVendor</code> values</a> may help. Next, run the <code>adb devices</code> to make sure your device is in the list. If device appears to be "no permission", you need to restart adb server (e.g. <code>adb kill-server;adb start-server</code>).</li>
   <li>If you use the <code>android-tools-adb</code> package from Debian, ADB Helper may force any existing ADB server to close. This package disables TCP connections to the server, which ADB Helper relies on.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>If you use Windows:
  <ul>
   <li>Make sure that your Android device is recognized correctly and that it is using the Google USB Driver that is included with the Android SDK.</li>
  </ul>
 </li>
 <li>If you use macOS:
  <ul>
   <li>If you're an EasyTether user, you will need to uninstall or disable EasyTether: <code>sudo kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/EasyTetherUSBEthernet.kext</code></li>
  </ul>
 </li>
</ul>
