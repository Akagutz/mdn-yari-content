<p><strong>高精确度时间</strong>标准定义了一个 {{domxref("Performance")}} 接口，支持应用程序内的客户端延迟测量。</p>

<p>The {{domxref("Performance")}} interfaces are considered <em>high resolution</em> because they are accurate to a thousandth of a millisecond (subject to hardware or software constraints). The interfaces support a number of use cases including calculating frame-rates (potentially important in animations) and benchmarking (such as the time to load a resource).</p>

<p>Since a platform's <em>system clock</em> is subject to various <em>skews</em> (such as NTP adjustments), the interfaces support a <em>monotonic clock</em> i.e. a clock that is always increasing. As such, the <code>Performance</code> API defines a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} type rather than using the {{jsxref("Date.now","Date.now()")}} interface.</p>

<h2 id="DOMHighResTimeStamp">DOMHighResTimeStamp</h2>

<p>The {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} type, as its name implies, represents a high resolution point in time. This type is a <code>double</code> and is used by the performance interfaces. The value could be a discrete point in time or the difference in time between two discrete points in time.</p>

<p>The unit of <code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code> is milliseconds and should be accurate to 5 µs (microseconds). However, If the browser is unable to provide a time value accurate to 5 microseconds (because, for example, due to hardware or software constraints), the browser can represent a the value as a time in milliseconds accurate to a millisecond.</p>

<h2 id="Methods">Methods</h2>

<p>The <code>{{domxref("Performance")}}</code> interface has two methods. The {{domxref("Performance.now","now()")}} method returns a {{domxref("DOMHighResTimeStamp")}} whose value that depends on the {{domxref("PerformanceTiming.navigationStart","navigation start")}} and scope. If the scope is a window, the value is the time the browser context was created and if the scope is a {{domxref("Worker","worker")}}, the value is the time the worker was created.</p>

<p>The {{domxref("Performance.toJSON","toJSON()")}} method returns a serialization of the {{domxref("Performance")}} object, for those attributes that can be serialized.</p>

<h2 id="Properties">Properties</h2>

<p>The <code>{{domxref("Performance")}}</code> interface has two properties. The {{domxref("Performance.timing","timing")}} property returns a {{domxref("PerformanceTiming")}} object containing latency-related performance information such as the start of navigation time, start and end times for redirects, start and end times for responses, etc.</p>

<p>The <code>{{domxref("Performance.navigation","navigation")}}</code> property returns a {{domxref("PerformanceNavigation")}} object representing the type of navigation that occurs in the given browsing context, such as the page was navigated to from history, the page was navigated to by following a link, etc.</p>

<h2 id="Implementation_status">Implementation status</h2>

<p>As shown in the {{domxref("Performance")}} interface's <a href="/Web/API/Performance#Browser_compatibility">Browser Compatibility</a> table, most of these interfaces are broadly implemented by desktop browsers.</p>

<p>To test your browser's support for the {{domxref("Performance")}} interface, run the <code><a href="http://mdn.github.io/web-performance/perf-api-support.html">perf-api-support</a></code> application.</p>
