<p class="summary">Web Authentication API 继承自 <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API">Credential Management API</a> ,使用公钥密码学使得验证更强壮, 不需要SMS文本就能实现无密码验证和安全的双因素验证.</p>

<h2 id="Web_authentication_概念和用例">Web authentication 概念和用例</h2>

<p>Web Authentication API (也称作WebAuthn) 使用<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">asymmetric (public-key) cryptography</a> (不对称加密)替代密码或SMS文本在网站上注册,验证, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication">second-factor authentication</a>(双因素验证). 解决了<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing">phishing</a>(钓鱼), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_breach">data breaches</a>(数据破坏), SMS 文本攻击,其它双因素验证等重大安全问题. 同时显著提高易用性(因为用户不必管理许多越来越复杂的密码).</p>

<p>许多网站已实现用户注册账号,登录已有账号的页面, WebAuthn 作为这些页面的替代和补充. 类似其他形式的 <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Credential_Management_API">Credential Management API</a>(凭据管理API), Web Authentication API 有两个对应于注册和登录的基本方法:</p>

<ul>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create">navigator.credentials.create()</a> - 当使用publicKey选项时, 创建一个新的凭据, 无论是用于注册新账号还是将新的非对称密钥凭据与已有的账号关联.</li>
 <li><a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/get">navigator.credentials.get()</a> - 当使用publicKey选项时, 使用一组现有的凭据进行身份验证服务, 无论是用于用户登录还是双因素验证中的一步.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>请注意:</strong> create() 和 get() 都需要在 <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts">Secure Context</a>(安全上下文)中执行 (e.g. - 使用https链接,或者是localhost), 当浏览器不是在安全环境下时将不可用.</p>

<p>In their most basic forms, both create() and get() receive a very large random number called a challenge from the server and they return the challenge signed by the private key back to the server. This proves to the server that a user is in possession of the private key required for authentication without revealing any secrets over the network.</p>

<p>In order to understand how the create() and get() methods fit into the bigger picture, it is important to understand that they sit between two components that are outside the browser:</p>

<ol>
 <li><strong>Server</strong> - the WebAuthn API is intended to register new credentials on a server (also referred to as a service or a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relying_party">relying party</a>) and later use those same credentials on that same server to authenticate a user.</li>
 <li><strong>Authenticator</strong> - the credentials are created and stored in a device called an authenticator. This is a new concept in authentication: when authenticating using passwords, the password is stored in a user's brain and no other device is needed; when authenticating using WebAuthn, the password is replaced with a key pair that is stored in an authenticator. The authenticator may be embedded into an operating system, such as Windows Hello, or may be a physical token, such as a USB or Bluetooth Security Key.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Registration">Registration</h3>

<p>A typical registration process has six steps, as illustrated in Figure 1 and described further below. This is a simplification of the data required for the registration process that is only intended to provide an overview. The full set of required fields, optional fields, and their meanings for creating a registration request can be found in the {{domxref("PublicKeyCredentialCreationOptions")}} dictionary. Likewise, the full set of response fields can be found in the {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} interface (where {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential.response")}} is the {{domxref("AuthenticatorAttestationResponse")}} interface). Note most JavaScript programmers that are creating an application will only really care about steps 1 and 5 where the create() function is called and subsequently returns; however, steps 2, 3, and 4 are essential to understanding the processing that takes place in the browser and authenticator and what the resulting data means.</p>

<p><img alt="WebAuthn registration component and dataflow diagram" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15801/MDN%20Webauthn%20Registration%20(r3).png" style="height: 546px; width: 1118px;"></p>

<p><em>Figure 1 - a diagram showing the sequence of actions for a WebAuthn registration and the essential data associated with each action.</em></p>

<p>The registration steps are:</p>

<ol start="0">
 <li><strong>Application Requests Registration</strong> - The application makes the initial registration request. The protocol and format of this request is outside of the scope of WebAuthn.</li>
 <li><strong>Server Sends Challenge, User Info, and Relying Party Info </strong>- The server sends a challenge, user information, and relying party information to the JavaScript program. The protocol for communicating with the server is not specified and is outside of the scope of WebAuthn. Typically, server communications would be <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST">REST</a> over https (probably using <a href="/en-US/docs/User:maybe/webidl_mdn/XMLHttpRequest_API">XMLHttpRequest</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a>), but they could also be <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/SOAP">SOAP</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549">RFC 2549</a> or nearly any other protocol provided that the protocol is secure. The parameters received from the server will be passed to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/create">create()</a> call, typically with little or no modification and returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a> that will resolve to a {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} containing an {{domxref("AuthenticatorAttestationResponse")}}. <strong>Note that it is absolutely critical that the challenge be a large buffer of random information (e.g. - more than 100 bytes) and it MUST be generated on the server in order to ensure the security of the registration process.</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Browser Calls authenticatorMakeCredential() on Authenticator</strong> - Internally, the browser will validate the parameters and fill in any defaults, which become the {{domxref("AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON")}}. One of the most important parameters is the origin, which is recorded as part of the clientData so that the origin can be verified by the server later. The parameters to the create() call are passed to the authenticator, along with a SHA-256 hash of the clientDataJSON (only a hash is sent because the link to the authenticator may be a low-bandwidth NFC or Bluetooth link and the authenticator is just going to sign over the hash to ensure that it isn't tampered with).</li>
 <li><strong>Authenticator Creates New Key Pair and Attestation</strong> - Before doing anything, the authenticator will typically ask for some form of user verification. This could be entering a PIN, using a fingerprint, doing an iris scan, etc. to prove that the user is present and consenting to the registration. After the user verification, the authenticator will create a new asymmetric key pair and safely store the private key for future reference. The public key will become part of the attestation, which the authenticator will sign over with a private key that was burned into the authenticator during its manufacturing process and that has a certificate chain that can be validated back to a root of trust.</li>
 <li><strong>Authenticator Returns Data to Browser</strong> - The new public key, a globally unique credential id, and other attestation data are returned to the browser where they become the attestationObject.</li>
 <li><strong>Browser Creates Final Data, Application sends response to Server</strong> - The create() Promise resolves to an {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}}, which has a {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential.rawId")}} that is the globally unique credential id along with a response that is the {{domxref("AuthenticatorAttestationResponse")}} containing the {{domxref("AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON")}} and {{domxref("AuthenticatorAttestationResponse.attestationObject")}}. The {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} is sent back to the server using any desired formatting and protocol (note that the ArrayBuffer properties need to be be base64 encoded or similar).</li>
 <li><strong>Server Validates and Finalizes Registration</strong> - Finally, the server is required to perform a series of checks to ensure that the registration was complete and not tampered with. These include:
  <ol>
   <li>Verifying that the challenge is the same as the challenge that was sent</li>
   <li>Ensuring that the origin was the origin expected</li>
   <li>Validating that the signature over the clientDataHash and the attestation using the certificate chain for that specific model of the authenticator</li>
  </ol>
  A complete list of validation steps <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#registering-a-new-credential">can be found in the WebAuthn specification</a>. Assuming that the checks pan out, the server will store the new public key associated with the user's account for future use -- that is, whenever the user desires to use the public key for authentication.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="Authentication">Authentication</h3>

<p>After a user has registered with WebAuthn, they can subsequently authenticate (a.k.a. - login or sign-in) with the service. The authentication flow looks similar to the registration flow, and the illustration of actions in Figure 2 may be recognizable as being similar to the illustration of registration actions in Figure 1. The primary differences between registration and authentication are that: 1) authentication doesn't require user or relying party information; and 2) authentication creates an assertion using the previously generated key pair for the service rather than creating an attestation with the key pair that was burned into the authenticator during manufacturing. Again, the description of authentication below is a broad overview rather than getting into all the options and features of WebAuthn. The specific options for authenticating can be found in the {{domxref("PublicKeyCredentialRequestOptions")}} dictionary, and the resulting data can be found in the {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} interface (where {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential.response")}} is the {{domxref("AuthenticatorAssertionResponse")}} interface) .</p>

<p><img alt="WebAuthn authentication component and dataflow diagram" src="https://mdn.mozillademos.org/files/15802/MDN%20Webauthn%20Authentication%20(r1).png" style="height: 527px; width: 1067px;"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2 - similar to Figure 1, a diagram showing the sequence of actions for a WebAuthn authentication and the essential data associated with each action.</em></p>

<ol start="0">
 <li><strong>Application Requests Authentication</strong> - The application makes the initial authentication request. The protocol and format of this request is outside of the scope of WebAuthn.</li>
 <li><strong>Server Sends Challenge</strong> - The server sends a challenge JavaScript program. The protocol for communicating with the server is not specified and is outside of the scope of WebAuthn. Typically, server communications would be <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST">REST</a> over https (probably using <a href="/en-US/docs/User:maybe/webidl_mdn/XMLHttpRequest_API">XMLHttpRequest</a> or <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API">Fetch</a>), but they could also be <a href="/en-US/docs/Glossary/SOAP">SOAP</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2549">RFC 2549</a> or nearly any other protocol provided that the protocol is secure. The parameters received from the server will be passed to the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/CredentialsContainer/get">get()</a> call, typically with little or no modification. <strong>Note that it is absolutely critical that the challenge be a large buffer of random information (e.g. - more than 100 bytes) and it MUST be generated on the server in order to ensure the security of the authentication process.</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Browser Call authenticatorGetCredential()  on Authenticator</strong> - Internally, the browser will validate the parameters and fill in any defaults, which become the {{domxref("AuthenticatorResponse.clientDataJSON")}}. One of the most important parameters is the origin, which recorded as part of the clientData so that the origin can be verified by the server later. The parameters to the create() call are passed to the authenticator, along with a SHA-256 hash of the clientDataJSON (only a hash is sent because the link to the authenticator may be a low-bandwidth NFC or Bluetooth link and the authenticator is just going to sign over the hash to ensure that it isn't tampered with).</li>
 <li><strong>Authenticator Creates an Assertion</strong> - The authenticator finds a credential for this service that matches the Relying Party ID and prompts a user to consent to the authentication. Assuming both of those steps are successful, the authenticator will create a new assertion by signing over the clientDataHash and authenticatorData with the private key generated for this account during the registration call.</li>
 <li><strong>Authenticator Returns Data to Browser</strong> -  The authenticator returns the authenticatorData and assertion signature back to the browser.</li>
 <li><strong>Browser Creates Final Data, Application sends response to Server</strong> - The browser resolves the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise">Promise</a> to a {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential")}} with a {{domxref("PublicKeyCredential.response")}} that contains the {{domxref("AuthenticatorAssertionResponse")}}. It is up to the JavaScript application to transmit this data back to the server using any protocol and format of its choice.</li>
 <li><strong>Server Validates and Finalizes Authentication</strong> - Upon receiving the result of the authentication request, the server performs validation of the response such as:
  <ol>
   <li>Using the public key that was stored during the registration request to validate the signature by the authenticator.</li>
   <li>Ensuring that the challenge that was signed by the authenticator matches the challenge that was generated by the server.</li>
   <li>Checking that the Relying Party ID is the one expected for this service.</li>
  </ol>
  A full list of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#verifying-assertion">steps for validating an assertion can be found in the WebAuthn specification</a>. Assuming the validation is successful, the server will note that the user is now authenticated. This is outside the scope of the WebAuthn specification, but one option would be to drop a new cookie for the user session.</li>
</ol>
