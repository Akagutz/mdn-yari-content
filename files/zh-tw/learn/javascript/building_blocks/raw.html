<p class="summary">在本單元中，我們繼續介紹所有JavaScript的關鍵基本功能，將注意力轉向常見的代碼塊類型，如條件語句，循環，函數和事件。 你已經在課程中看到了這些東西，但只是順便說一下 - 在這裡我們將明確地討論它。</p>

<h2 id="先決條件">先決條件</h2>

<p>Before starting this module, you should have some familiarity with the basics of <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML">HTML</a> and <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS">CSS</a>, and you should have also worked through our previous module, <a href="/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps">JavaScript first steps</a>.</p>

<div class="note">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are working on a computer/tablet/other device where you don't have the ability to create your own files, you could try out (most of) the code examples in an online coding program such as <a href="http://jsbin.com/">JSBin</a> or <a href="https://thimble.mozilla.org/">Thimble</a>.</p>

 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/%E6%A2%9D%E4%BB%B6">在代碼中做出決定 - 條件</a></dt>
 <dd>在任何編程語言中，代碼都需要根據不同的輸入做出決策並相應地執行操作。 例如，在遊戲中，如果玩家的生命數量為0，則遊戲結束。 在天氣應用程序中，如果在早上查看，則顯示日出圖形; 如果是夜晚，則顯示星星和月亮。 在本文中，我們將探討條件結構如何在JavaScript中工作。</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code" rel="nofollow">程式碼迴圈</a></dt>
 <dd>Sometimes you need a task done more than once in a row. For example, looking through a list of names. In programming, loops perform this job very well. Here we will look at loop structures in JavaScript.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions" rel="nofollow">函式 — 可重複使用的程式碼區塊</a></dt>
 <dd>Another essential concept in coding is <strong>functions. Functions</strong> allow you to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block, and then call that code whenever you need it using a single short command — rather than having to type out the same code multiple times. In this article we'll explore fundamental concepts behind functions such as basic syntax, how to invoke and define functions, scope, and parameters.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Build_your_own_function" rel="nofollow">建立自己的函式</a></dt>
 <dd>With most of the essential theory dealt with in the previous article, this article provides a practical experience. Here you'll get some practice with building up your own custom function. Along with way, we'll also explain some further useful details of dealing with functions.</dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Return_values" rel="nofollow">函式回傳值</a></dt>
 <dd>There's one last essential concept for us to discuss in this course, to close our look at functions — return values. Some functions don't return a significant value after completion, but others do. It's important to understand what their values are, how to make use of them in your code, and how to make your own custom functions return useful values. </dd>
 <dt><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events" rel="nofollow">事件介紹</a></dt>
 <dd>Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming, which the system tells you about so you can respond to them in some way if desired. For example if the user clicks a button on a webpage, you might want to respond to that action by displaying an information box. In this final article we will discuss some important concepts surrounding events, and look at how they work in browsers.</dd>

<p>The following assessment will test your understanding of the JavaScript basics covered in the guides above.</p>

 <dd>Now that we've looked at the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, we'll test your knowledge of loops, functions, conditionals and events by building a fairly common item you'll see on a lot of websites — a JavaScript-powered image gallery.</dd>
